For Saturday morning's activity, I decided to organize a small team for trekking the nice and simple route of Kranji Memorial trek once again. However, as the weather gods would have it, I woke up to ominous looking skies. Soon, it started pouring and one by one, people decided to back out. Finally, only Jane, Felix, Jervais and I were left. But hey, the weather turned out to be really awsome! Raving to go, people!",Fulfilled
1,"It was hectic. Then on top of that the one and ONLY day I have ever worn a skirt and pantyhose to work, I had to spend the afternoon crawling on the floor under my desk plugging shit in. I am not a dressy person, I don't like dresses and skirts. I would much rather wear pants, and I certainly do not like pantyhoes or stockings of any kind. But I live in the south, and ladies are expected to wear them if they are showing any leg at all, it is just not socially acceptable in my office not to do so. Also, I had super intentions of going to bed at like 9 tonight, but then matt IMed me wanted to talk, and the Sox/Yanks game was on, and I still haven't decided what I am going to wear tomorrow because again, I was under the impression that tomorrow was Friday and I could wear jeans because it was casual day. But no, tricksters and all, it's Thursday so I have to pull one more nice outfit and heels out of my ass for another day. And I have to come up with it now, because I am not to be trusted to do so in a timely manner in the mornings. I just am beginning to hate getting dressed more and more each day.",Unfulfilled
2,"Being a groomsman, I really didn't get the chance. Christine, however, was a shutterbug, even managing to capture the wedding ceremony on video as well as many of the speeches. The cake was wonderful - it was delivered with the curls to be added later, so of course it was up to me to make it look wonderful - I had many people coming up to me and asking me if I made the cake. Well, no, but I'm thinking about it... I wasn't included in the lsit of people for speeches, which initially was fine by me, but I had a small impromtu speech ready in case it was thrust upon me. However, as time went on people started asking me when my speech was. Eventually, I just decided to speak, and I can't even remember what I said, but people were very happy and proud of me for saying what I wanted to say. I am, too.",Fulfilled
3,"Before justice started school I had an idea to make him a new tote bag. His school prefers him to bring a tote bag rather than a book bag, and while I did have his from last year (which I only recently noticed definitely needed to be replaced) I decided to construct him one from a star Wars valance I found at a thrift store for a little less than $3. I hadn't sewn in years (probably since that disastrous Twister mat dress) so I was extremely rusty. Since I was preparing for Hurricane Hanna and was bracing myself for the worst, I chose to start Friday evening on the tote. Logan was sent out for felt, which I needed to create a ""J"" to personalize his tote. Logan came home with a little ""starter sewing kit"" and a silver metallic ribbon for the trim on the tote. Logan did cut out the pieces for me due to his anal-obsessive nature.",Fulfilled
4,"So for some reason (I dunno wad) I was under the impression that 1ECTS credit would be counted as 1 credit back in Japan so I decided to take courses totalling 20 credits... And when I told my other European/russian friends that I only had to do 20 ECTS, they were really envious because everyone was doing at least 30 and they all had crappy days with like 8 hours of lessons straight... and I was happily looking at my extremely free days, planning little trips and what-not... But I met Mayumi today me: Mayumi: ECTS me: Mayumi: 70/40=1.75 which means I have to take an average of 31.5 ECTS per sem... So after desperately searching for more courses, my final selection looks like this Economic, social and cultural rights under international human rights law Political Communication",Unfulfilled
5,"But I've had two recently that have stuck with me. One involved a girl I knew in high school, Ashley Brooks. I was helping her paint a dresser pink and purple and we kept running into all kinds of problems with where to stop one color and start the next and how to keep the paint from peeling off. While I'm not sure what this really means, I gotta say that it was nice to see her again even if I didn't really see her. Last night I dreamed that I was jealous of the guitar amp given to my brother Chris by my parents. He decided to help me get my own so we saved up a couple of pocketfuls of crispy M&ms and were going to sell them to this giant Walmart thrift store in order to get enough money to buy me one. While we were there, unfortunately, my sculpture teacher, who was shopping there with her infant son, confiscated my precious sack of second hand M&ms so my brother and I settled for browsing the store's selection of old-timey deep sea diving suits. This was unmistakeably the greatest store ever! Of course, my brother really has no use for a guitar amp, nor do I for that matter, and my sculpture teacher doesn't have any children. But it was still I suprisingly vivid dream.",Unfulfilled
6,"This is a favor nobody can give even if I want it to take anything I could afford. When I regret it, realize it, or want to change it, it is always too late. I dont want this happen to me again. It could be misunderstanding, miscommunication or just my cocky skin deep attitude trying to save my silly face. I prayed once but I did not mean it. I had a big ego, I wanted to be different, I thought everyone was my enemy and I could beat all of them. God, I was wrong and please take care of me through all this. This time I mean it, and hopefully it is not too late. I will try my best to make my life better, be good to my family, be good to my friends and to the people around me. I will stop complaining, stop cursing, I will try to be a better man. God, please help me, to be a better man.",Unknown
7,"Some of you might have heard that I sold my HTC TyTN II 3 months ago. I wanted to get the new iPhone 3g when it was released but I only can get it if I subscribe to the line, which I don't need. I just got my new line in Dec and it's still under contract till next year. After waiting for 2 mths, I gave up and decided to buy the HTC Diamond Plus but they told me no more English version and not sure when will have stock. Argh! Then that day, I was checking out my friend's phone and found it rather ok. He told me I can get 10% off cos HSBC was having promotion but last day la. So I quickly call Paul and asked him to help me to buy from Central. Finally, I got a new phone - Samsung TouchWiz F488!!!",Unfulfilled
8,"Slipknot hoodie and jeans. There was a lot of public transporting mishap with catching the wrong bus and missing the meet up with Lauren and then veering off of the main road headed into suburbia. Jason climbed up a bus stop sign and I put too much vodka in a bottle of coke, but eventually we got Lauren and ran to our bus that was at traffic lights, jumped on and arrived at Mike's at about 9pm. The party didn't pick up much at all and eventually I gave up on drinking the cheap vodka mixed with multi-V juice and watched Bridget Jones ""Edge of reason"" instead. More people rocked up at about 11pm and I knew them but watching Mike fondle with Ashley had put me off socialising. I stayed cuddled up with Kirsty most of the night and I decided to take over Mike's bed since he was such a bad host (he had disappeared with Ashley for about an hour) and go to sleep. I awoke early morning when Kirsty had left the bed and I tried to go back to sleep but everyone said they wanted to go home. So we skipped the idea of catching two buses and walked a little bit to catch the main bus.",Fulfilled
9,"Well, my wife and I did. She surprised me by taking me to the prince William County Fair over on Dumfries Road- we'd both been kind of stressed with work, and decided to just get out to something different. It was kind of like the Fairfax fair, but just in a different locale. It was 'Dollar night', which got us in the gate for a buck a head; about 30 minutes and $12 later, we were having our pictures taken with sea lions from their live animal show (named Kim and Stella- I'll have to see if I can scan the pic in for posting later). We smelled like fish for awhile after. Toured around a bit, and had some fried oreos (mm-mm, healthy!). Getting out was much easier than getting in traffic-wise... came home, and helped build the music mix for the 80s party my wife is having with her girlfriends this weekend.",Fulfilled
10,"So, I got a tattoo to match one that Robert had: I went at 50 Sunday night. The tattoo artist bill was cool. He obviously wanted to make more changes to the design, but once I explained why I wanted it, he was cool with keeping it as close as possible. He took about a half an hour to ""tighten it up"". I got mine on my back instead of the arm, because I wanted Joker to have my back as always. Here is the stencil: Here he is getting started: It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, less than a bad zit, but it does accumulate on you. It was pretty bad here, since I had just passed out. I had to take a bit to collect myself before we could go again.",Unfulfilled
11,"I swear to god she's the only person I can do that with. I laid there thinking about how unenjoyable the stars were because she wasn't there next to me looking at them. I love her so much. She's my light. I laid there whistling the tune that had been stuck in my head, making me think about her and I was sad that she wasn't there hearing me whistle the tune to her. I wanted to hold her in my arms, laying on the back of that car, leaning against the back window and staring into the night sky, hoping that somewhere else underneath is she's sleeping peacefully and somehow in some way I know that part of me is there with her protecting her and loving her always. I love her.",Unfulfilled
12,"Okay, let's give this whole getting-back-into-Second-Life thing another shot, shall we? I really did mean it when I said in my last post that I wanted to reconnect with SL, it's just that RL has decided to interfere even more than it typically does. My family had planned a weekend trip down south to see my extended family for the first time in over a year; while there, my grandmother passed away, and we decided to stay for the funeral. So, needless to say, I've been gone longer than expected, and haven't been around SL. But I'm back, starting now. Last night I spent a few hours reconnecting with Lanna in-world, which ranked right up there next to ""sleeping in my own bed"" on the list of things I was looking forward to doing when I returned home. Over the next few days, I will try slip back into my SL groove, spend some time thinking about where to take the blog, and recommitting myself to becoming part of the resident community again.",Fulfilled

So on Sunday on one of those typical weather seaside (grey, windy and cold) Simonsatori took me to Hunstanton in Norfolk. First we stopped at the lavender centre, after all I am from the lavender County and I wanted to check the UK version... no proper lavender oil but some beetroot wine and cute frogs to purchase. Hunstanton has the biggest joke shop in Britain and so many tempting tacky Halloween stuffs... we were in there for a while.

14,"Sibley Volcanic Park: View from visitors Center, oil on panel, 12x9 Ok, it wasn't really in the dark, but I was in deep shade and could barely tell what colors I was mixing. Yesterday I went to an outdoor even in the blinding sun and 105 degree heat and came home with a migraine. I really wanted to paint with my plein air group today, but just couldn't take another day in the sun so I set up in the shade of the visitor center at Sibley Volcanic regional Park in Oakland where we were to meet at 2:00 for our group critique. Bicyclists and hikers stopped by all afternoon to eat lunch in the shade, get water, or use the restrooms. Two hardcore women cyclists spent their entire lunch discussing in great detail their recent fruit purchases. Another woman cyclist in full cycling gear told her cycling buddy that her ex-husband married her ex-best friend. So she started dating that woman's ex-husband. But when her ex-husband and ex-best friend divorced, she and former best friend fell in love and recently got married thanks to California's same sex marriage law.",Unfulfilled
15,"So I've been planning an outing for clients this past week, scheduled for today. We went to Mr. Greek for lunch after morning program. Last night I had this dream that we were out for lunch and the menu at the place had changed (or I was in the wrong place) and they had nothing but chicken on the menu (one of my clients [my favourite one, if you must know] doesn't eat chicken) and the service was terrible and some people got their food at some point, but the rest of us hadn't even gotten our orders taken and it was 1:15 and the bus was coming at 10 and it was a big disaster. Needless to say, none of that actually happened I had no last minute cancellations of clients or people kicking up a stink because they wanted to go on the trip and couldn't, the bus was on time, we got loaded up in record time because I started bugging people to go to the bathroom 15 minutes early, we got there and our table was ready, I proposed my food idea (since the portions are rather large and seniors don't eat much, I decided we'd order a bunch of chicken souvlaki and some pork souvlaki which came with Greek salad and I chose potatoes as the side and then we just divvied them up among us) and everyone agreed and it all went well and everyone enjoyed it. My other worry was the bill because not knowing exactly what people would want, I wasn't sure how much it would come to and I did some worst case scenario planning in my head beforehand so I'd have some idea of what we'd end up charging the clients. It's okay if it's expensive... it's just that we do an activity fee on their bill that is the amount they need to pay for any outings. Generally we like to keep it to $10 or less, and I was worried that if it ended up being more than that (since we also have to pay the transportation to get there) I would get complaints. But with my food plan, including an extra salad and tea and coffee for some people, the total was just under $90 (before tip but after tax).",Fulfilled

The police never seen anything that killed him but since he was a colored person, they probabl didnt care. He was a nobody and I didnt know he was like that. I felt so betrayed because of it and wanted to just quit it and leave the house. Another trial was the fact that a dispute happend between my sister and her teacher.

Unfortunately the practical is on different material, so I don't think this is a logical thought process. Carla and I went to see Othello at the VA Shakespeare Festival yesterday. We were both really excited about it, but were pretty disappointed. It was set in post-Apartheid South Africa, which is not an absolutely terrible idea for Othello but in this case it didn't work. It also didn't help that the chorus kept banging on drums and shit and I wanted to tell them to shut up and that Othello kept stumbling over his lines. We went outside during intermission weighing our feelings: Oh-dear-God-there's-still-an-hour-and-a-half-of-this vs. I-feel-bad-for-leaving. While we were debating, we ran into Lisa (Johanson) and Mikey (G-something, who works in the ticket office at Ferguson), and then Jordan (McArthur) turned up. They were like, ""Yeah... we don't know if we're going to stay... "" And then we were standing around talking about the things we didn't like and decided that VSF should have set their entire season (Othello, the taming of the shrew, and the complete history of America, abridged in South Africa).

20,"I didn't see this coming for a while longer yet - and even then more likely with the older of my two daughters. But hey, life comes at you fast apparently this morning I found myself in an argument with Emma - now 4 - about the length of the dress she wished to wear. I sat staunchly on the bed brandishing the dress in one hand and a pair of shorts in the other; the shorts to go under the dress to maintain a father's idea of proper dignity - the exact length of dignity being listed in the father's almanac of course. Emma stood in front of me on one foot and then the other - because she was stamping by this point - yelling ""I'm not going to show my undies!"" Before this point, the situation had already been complicated by my initial misunderstanding of her outburst. I thought she was afraid that she _would_ show her undies (ah, the wishful thinking of a naive father), hence my chivalrous move to grab a pair of shorts. Turns out, no, she was quite adamant she could take care of any ""undie showing"" all by herself thankyou very much.",Unknown
21,"Did anyone else watch the ch9 movie today, suddenly 30? I've seen it before, but I couldn't get anyone to go with me to the movies tonight so I watched it again. Firstly, it made me think about when I was 13 - I didn't do any of the things those 13yr olds did, although part of the reason may have been that I was never allowed to socialise outside of school or have friends over except for my birthday parties (which is probably why I like to have a party every yr... ). I never felt the need to wear mid-drift-revealing clothing or stuff tissues down my top (although I didnt really need the tissues, since those areas started growing on their own at 10yrs of age), nor did I ever dance to songs on the radio or video clips on TV (I didnt really know any songs back then). I don't know if I was really slow to grow up, or if I just missed something along the way. For most of my childhood I felt happy to be and stay a kid and never wished to be any older, to the extent that I sometimes dreaded getting older and wished I could always stay young. The second thing the movie made me think about just how old I really am - I'm 21, and what have I done with my life? contrary to the end of the previous paragraph, once nearing the end of high school I had accepted that I was going to grow up regardless of how much I didn't want to, and instead started looking forward to going to uni and starting the rest of my life. I always hated all that waiting that went on between not being a kid anymore and becoming a fully-grown fully-competent adult, and I thought that things would dramatically change once I hit uni. Then I thought things would change when I started dating. Then I thought it would be when I moved out of home (although I only moved into my grandma's house, which has similarities to a home, but it was still a big step). Now I'm wondering if life will ever change - I always thought that by 21 I would already be on the path to a career I had decided on, and I'd have a group of friends I regularly keep in contact with and go out with and be able to talk to when I need to, I'd be able to drive places (which would certainly help with the previous statement), I would have found someone to love that also loved me, I would have sorted out my emotional problems, live in my own place where I didnt have anyone to answer to when late home...",Unfulfilled
22,"This made me quite happy, now knowing that the people who were basically the first new friends I had made since moving to this side of the country now enjoy the same things as I. I had kept my greenage usage pretty quiet from them, as since they were getting a larger family and I figured that they would be moving on from that, as all I knew was what my parents did which was pretty much nothing. Yeah, I grew up sheltered . But ever since I started hanging out with them again, and have several times in the past few weeks, reality has started to hit. Hard. I realize now that while I was having fun the past few years toking up, I always thought that one day soon I'd have to put the pipe down and actually be an adult, as much as I wished to avoid that. But lately, expecially the way things are going at work, and how I've finally started to get things in order, it has come to my attention that I am an adult, no matter how much I don't really feel like one. The only real basis I have on being an adult is what I learned from my own parents, and maybe a little bit from other family or their friends (which was basically just like them), and I gotta tell ya, there lives seemed very, very boring. And I always knew that it was not what I wanted.",Unfulfilled

But there are things that I wanted to do as a child that I have accomplished, though not in the same straight-line way as Randy. For instance, I loved reading National Geographic and wanted to travel in the wilderness and live the outdoor life. I also wanted to be a psychologist.

Right when we walked in (after we walked past the beach volleyball court), they had a projector showing all the things people were Googleing (Googling?) in real time. It was funny to see all the different things people were looking for -- you had your standard argument settling searches (how many home runs did willy Mays hit in 1965), then you had your super obscure searches (what is the national bird of Tansania), and even though the Google people told us that there were a bunch of filters on what shows up on the big board, I caught one search for ""milf's""... it's the internet, what're you gonna do?

My mom keeps falling and her arthritis has gotten so bad in her hips and back that she has trouble getting around. I am here (in Georgia) and they are there (in South Carolina) and there isn't much I can do from here. I came to Georgia to figure some thing out, to heal, to find my way, to find the missing part of me that I had misplaced a long time ago, and to change my life around. I wanted a fresh start. I wanted to get my life together for myself, my kids, and because I felt like I owed to myself and everyone I loved to do so.

Either way, I (fortunately) didn't have to be on campus until 11 for a class, but I rushed around anyway, which I hate doing, because I wanted to get there in time to get a space in the first lot. A little background for those of you not familiar with MSU: There are two (and only two) Good ways into MSU: National and grand. National is a nightmare at any time of day and a little out of my way, so I usually take Kansas expressway, one of the main bypasses around the city, to Grand. The lot I park in is on Grand. There are two lots, actually - one more or less across the street from the English building and one about a block down.",Unknown

Mostly I just really wanted to be home last night so I was grumpy. I'm still a little grumpy.

Look at that faace. We put her up in mom and Dad's giant bathroom and she's so curious and isn't freaked out by people at all. She's a total doll and she has a huge purr and I loves her stompy feets omgg kitty.

Holy crap, it was also overblown and hilarious. I discovered that the Fatboy Slim song ""Weapon of choice"" rips off lines from this movie!

While attending vacation Bible School one summer, I went and visited the pastor, and told him that I wanted to get saved. That day he prayed a prayer with me. I walked the aisle the following Sunday, and was baptized soon after that. Life seemed to be going good, but I was only in second grade, so I mean really, how bad could it be?

She was perfection personified; she was the most beautiful of all God's creatures, more beautiful than all combined.

I wished to take her hand with mine, but some strange force was keeping me at bay, making sure I couldn't move, so as not to interrupt her ethereal presence in front of me.

One of the cold, hard facts of divorce is that you no longer have a right to access every part of your child's life. This is probably why husband was so devastated by his divorce to begin with, he was forced into part-time parenthood by BM's desire to end the marriage. But I digress.

75,"It was one of the most amazing times of my life and a perfect combination of those two childhood dreams. We spent 3 weeks in the high-desert of South-central Idaho with each group of kids, teaching them how to live off the land, make fire without matches, navigate with topographical maps, and be self-sufficient, while leading them through a brief curriculum designed to stimulate their self-analysis. It's amazing the effect such training has on the self-esteem of a bored and rebellious teenager. Or on the self-esteem of a bored and frustrated 30 year old. Knowing that I can walk into the wilds and make fire, find food, and live an interesting life - when most people would panic or focus on complaining - gives me a rare insight into my inner strength and resourcefulness. I also wanted to be Perry Mason. His style of investigative advocay just thrilled me. I worked at my first law firm when I was 19 and got a taste of the real lawyering world. I even completed a year of law school. But by then I knew the downside of lawyering - lawfirm politics, long associate hours, high production stress, no recognition for anyone but the partners (ohmygosh, I just realized that the corporate world is my nightmare version of the legal world) - and I decided not to complete my law degree. Then in 1995, I was introduced to the king County Casa organization and became a guardian ad litem for abused and neglected children.",Unfulfilled

I was very insulted, that she'd diagnosed me from some stupid magazine. I stopped her flicking, and explained this, and left the room.

Calvin also attended his first mainly music class. I loved that he got an opportunity to interact with other kiddos at church, and I got a chance to meet other moms! Oh, and of course we also had fun singing and dancing to songs. We also spent last week closing in on office space for my chiropractic practice which I hoped to open in early October. I found out on Saturday that the prospective landlord may have decided (VERY last MINUTE) to instead go with another tenant.

Is there a word for how you feel at the loss of someone you didn't know nearly well enough to claim grief for, but thought of as being an integral enough part of a corner of your existence that it would never have occurred to you to imagine the world without them? I probably met Isaac maybe five or six times, always when I was visiting friends at Harvard, usually on purim. He was the sort of person one remembers; I think a quote from him ended up as my purim away message on instant Messenger a year or two ago, though I didn't attribute it because, though I knew perfectly well who he was, I was rarely 100% sure of his name. He was someone I would have liked to have gotten to know better -- someone I had hoped to get the chance to get know better, and not just with the benefit of hindsight. I still haven't persuaded myself that, if anything purim does still happen at Harvard this year and I manage to attend, he is not in fact going to be there. It's just not possible. It also shatters -- or would, if I believed it -- the illusion of safety I've relied on in navigating the roads of Boston and Cambridge. There are few places I've felt more uneasy behind the wheel than mass Ave in Central Square, and I never felt very assured traversing some of the intersections on foot, either. When I lived in Brighton, my regular walk home required crossing a major intersection where the lights funneled the right-turning traffic into the crossing pedestrians, and a few years ago, a visiting friend came very close to being hit by a turning truck in Coolidge Corner.",Unfulfilled

We spoke a little, but it was loud and not suited for conversation there. I had hoped to ask him to join me for a drink or something after the show (if my courage would allow such a thing) but he left before the end and I didn't see him after that. Maybe I'll try missed connections lol. I didn't want to tell him I think he's cute or make any gay references during the show because if I was wrong that would make standing there the whole rest of the concert too awkward... Afterward, I wandered through the city making stops at several bars and clubs, met some new people, some old people (as in people I knew - I actually didn't met any old people, unless you count the tourist family whose dad asked me about my t-shirt).

I wanted to regroup and prepare for battle so I laid him down while I pseudo relaxed (e-mails are my friend). He became fussy after 10 minutes, which I anticipated, so I expressed some milk and gave him a bottle so I could heal from the last nursing session.

I colored my hair today, of course it does not look much different, just a lighter Auburn, which is what I was aiming for. I believe that the color I picked was the lightest brown I could find. I knew it would not turn out that light on me, but I wanted to tone down the darkness my hair had soaked up last time I colored. I decided that I would like some bangs or something, and went off to town to get it down.

The vet prescribed him some vitamin, antibiotic and something to help him ease the breathing. The vet said that if the symptoms started getting worse, we might have to consider putting him down (it's painless, the vet assured). We thought that it was best to keep trying and, if he was destined to die, we figured that he will die naturally. So we took him home, but by that time, he was weak and all he wanted to do was sleep. I came back late last night from a movie outing at around 3 am and was just about to go to sleep when I realized that the cat was not inside my room (he sleeps with me). So I came out of my room and heard him crying, agonized with pain inside the toilet. He was lying sideways and breathing very heavily, his mouth gasping for air.

The chamois leather that I am talking about is the lambskin kind, cured with fish oil, that we are all familiar with, that is used for washing cars and windows. Once this leather has been put in water it becomes stiff when it dries and can only be used after it is soaked. A flogger made from this and used wet is a massively thuddy toy that has the greater intensity that any water adds to a spanking combined with a rapid cooling effect after the stroke because it leaves the impact site wet. Why make a wet chamois leather flogger I have only been flogged with one of these once but it was a very special experience and I have wanted to own one ever since. I have never seen one for sale and the one that I was flogged with was home made (very roughly, chamois cut and nailed onto a bit of wood but it worked well). So the only option is to make my own. One I found on the web having searched the internet I did find plenty of chamois leather floggers but they where very expensive and not designed to be used wet. The only one that I found that was meant to be used wet is the one pictured above,that came from this SITE. It is also one made by an enthusiast for their own use and is not for sale.",Unfulfilled

There is not a camper spacious enough for that brood. Mom, knowing it would only be a matter of time before L-A asked to borrow money again, has proposed a solution. She and dad have wanted to purchase a rental property so they will have income after dad retires in a few years. His joints are going and he's drinking more, so it's a safe bet he'll go for early retirement.",Unfulfilled

I have been putting it off for a while now, (like 5 months) because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do to them, and I really wanted to try and paint them myself. So I headed to Walmart at 100 at night to get the paint and brushes, and then came home and went to work. I was nervous at first, but I had bought a bottle of white just in case I messed up, that way I could just repaint and give myself a clean canvas! Well below is the finished product, and I was tickled pink with how well they came out, they were exactly what I wanted them to be! They are going to be hanging on the wall once everything is said and done, but I [wanted to] go ahead and share them so I just propped them up for now! We also found a coming home from the hospital for him on Friday. I didn't want anything that would be uncomfortable for him, and was advised by several of the chicks to just get something along those lines. So here it is, hubby and I both really liked it, I can't wait to see him in it!",Fulfilled
110,"And the great thing about this year's break was that ETS was with me and two of my brothers came to spend their Christmas break with us. One of them actually stayed longeer than the break which was such a nice thing for ETS since she got someone to hang around with for the week after the break - besides I have someone to beat in the video games when I come back from office. I am sure he will tell you something different but I wanted to set the records straight before he bends them. One of my brothers wanted to beat me in a video game. So naturally I gave him the option of choosing the game and even the console (I don't have one). There was so much fuzz about the Wii I [wanted to] buy and give it a try. I thought I am probably not going to spend much time on it once the vacation is over besides I have heard it is very good and innovative. But for some reason this brother of mine didn't like that idea and keeps saying 'I will do my exercises in the gym', 'I am a lazy @#$ and... '. Then the other choices were Sony's play station II and Xbox 360 - we found out that the X box was cheaper so we picked one from best Buy.",Unfulfilled

I raided Wegmans this morning for all sorts of new and exciting things... some vegetarian chik'n nuggets, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, extra virgin olive oil, and even found me some quinoa spaghetti and actual quinoa in the organic bulk food section... I was quite pleased with myself. Apparently Wegmans didn't have any actual apricots (dried apricots, yes, but not undried ones)...

After she had attempted to take her own life, her sister Claire had moved into my apartment, apparently for an indefinite period and without offering to pay any rent. Claire introduced and enforced an undeclared law that my wife and I should never be left alone together, and whenever we all met, Polly would remain silent and Claire would do all the talking. I assumed that I had lost my wife for good. Were we ever to meet without our chaperone, we would have to learn how to talk to one another again. There was an occasion last week when I [wished to] rebuke my wife. She had turned on all of the taps in the apartment - because she likes the sound of running water and wishes the apartment to be always filled with the soothing gurgling of plugholes - and I wanted to try and teach her that things like water have a monetary value. I considered making a C.D. Of the sound of running taps and playing it perpetually on the living room stereo. But I did not know how to bring the subject up with Claire, and when I try to talk to her about money, she becomes indifferent and unresponsive. I was drinking all afternoon in the southern bar, and when I finally arrived home, Claire, Polly, and a scrawny looking youth in dirty shell-suit were sitting in the kitchen.",Unfulfilled

So I asked Pieter who the hell you are and what are you two going to do together. There wasnt much of, lets say, structure. Pieter told me about when he saw Marko for the first time: in sheep woolen trousers in a very still pose. Perhaps Pieter and I shared the exposure to the same experience.

Now, while I had not crush whatsoever on my art teacher, I did wake up wanting so badly to pierce my nipples. I hadn't even considered it before, but after dreaming that, I [wanted to] do it. After a month or so I desisted of the idea, probably because it's to painful for the little exposition it would get.

They were late so the meat was a tad cold and (IMO) dry, the potatoes weren't moist enough, the cornbread pudding was dry, and the gravy was bland. Of course, everyone raved about the dinner; but that's because they have never tasted my mom's cooking. I [wanted to] call her so badly and ask her how to make gravy. I want my mom back.

I started planning to uber two-year schedule today- the Ling minor is kind of throwing me off, but not all that much. I'm have to stick around here during the summer anyway in order to get residency and in-state tuition, so I'm probably just going to take staff photojournalism as a summer course. That keeps me right on track to graduate with a photojournalism concentration and linguistics minor. I [wanted to] do visual editing and management very much, but one of the core courses is such that it requires a prereq, which in turn requires its own prereq. And with the Ling thing, I have no extra space to take those classes. Further, one of them is reporting, which eats some 30 hours a week just by itself. Further further, I have a wee bit of a problem with doing the reporting thing, since the staff works for the Missourian, one of the town papers- but don't get paid. I realize the importance of hands-on learning, and I think it's great that we even have the opportunity to work for a 'real paper'... it's just so hard to reconcile the financial implications. That being said, I actually wrote my very first story today it is here: http/ww.columbiamissourian.com/storie s/2008/08/16/suspect-standoff-after-taco-b ell-incident/ and has been seriously edited because... geez, I've never reported on anything in my life, and the first thing that shows up for me is a crime piece?",Unfulfilled

But if I take both rooms then they will leave the sunroom as the office and make all the dogs, but pig, outside dogs except at night.

I didnt' feel like going out last night, as I dont feel like going out any night really. I was going to go with my roommate Emily, to this party. But then she ended up going without me, instead she went with Charlie. So I got a little pissed. Because I [wanted to] shoot footage at the party. And that's when I decided not to go at all.

This wasn't the first time, and in the past, I've always [wanted to] run away, silently attempted to resolve it on my own, and sought placebo resolutions such as drinking and partying or taking an overdose of sleeping pills. I was tempted to do the same again yesterday. In order for me to come to terms with this situation as just a setback and not an ultimate failure on my end to fulfill my current decisions to love myself, I cannot just hope it goes away with time and perhaps distance. After all, courage is not the absence of trepidations, and I am determined not to be a coward. In facing it, I must acknowledge my feelings and think through it to determine the root origin. You see, I've always known what I had to do for next time, but I never really thought about what caused it in the first place.",Unfulfilled

Dani decided she [wanted to] go to the party so I picked her up and we headed over there about an hour late. Josh and Jesse got there just as we did.

I did manage yesterday to: Change the curtains in the living and dining rooms package a shawl for a sick friend--who I did not know was in the hospital for the last 7 weeks sew buttons on the baby dress sew buttons on the tea wallets crochet a flower for the one tea cozy and attach it knit 3 leaves for the other tea cozy and attach them write up the pattern for the Alison shawl and get it on Ravelry as a free download knit 6 rows on the never Ending shawl(actual leaf Lace Shawl) Swiffer the bathroom and then wash the floor drink my half of a bottle of French wine enjoy the dinner my hubby prepared. This morning: I got up with Tom answered some pm's and some emails went back to bed went to Walmart to get a prescription and some odds and ends got p o'd when the pharmacy dept [decided to] open 20 minutes later then normal went to the spa for my breakfast and wrote out bills to go to the post Office went to said post Office went to Foodtown for supplies for today and tomorrow I will be car less tomorrow so no outings for me Jeannie, my youngest who is moving next week, had her 7 year old Kia Rio die yesterday, the timing belt went and the engine jammed up cracking the block now she must buy a new car, until that can happen she will need mine, she could use RAF's but it is supposed to rain huge and it would not be a good idea for him to take his motorcycle in said rain, especially since he has only had his license for about a week. On top of this there is a gentleman at the spa who insists on talking politics every morning, which is something I would rather not do. Every one is entitled to their opinion including him and including me but we don't come close to agreeing and he gets angry with me because he can't get me going. Now 2 years ago I switched where I have breakfast because one of the waitresses decided that I needed her religious saving, another topic I avoid at all costs.",Fulfilled
389,"Okay, let's give this whole getting-back-into-Second-Life thing another shot, shall we? I really did mean it when I said in my last post that I wanted to reconnect with SL, it's just that RL has decided to interfere even more than it typically does. My family had planned a weekend trip down south to see my extended family for the first time in over a year; while there, my grandmother passed away, and we [decided to] stay for the funeral. So, needless to say, I've been gone longer than expected, and haven't been around SL. But I'm back, starting now. Last night I spent a few hours reconnecting with Lanna in-world, which ranked right up there next to ""sleeping in my own bed"" on the list of things I was looking forward to doing when I returned home. Over the next few days, I will try slip back into my SL groove, spend some time thinking about where to take the blog, and recommitting myself to becoming part of the resident community again. Being gone - and this time, I'm talking gone gone, like no computer, no regular email, nothing - did help me gain some perspective on the disconnect I tried to describe in my last post.",Fulfilled
390,"Maryan * brought mystic Monk coffee to my attention last week, after posting she had seen their ad in faith & Family magazine. I am miserably behind in my recreational reading... the mag is still sitting in my inbox (hard copy snail mail, that is). Anyway, I [decided to] treat myself to their inexpensive sample offer. Like Marianne, I chose their hazelnut sample. When I was young and single, I loved drinking hazelnut coffee, which I graciously ground and shared with my father. My coffee choice nowadays is rather utilitarian: taste isn't as high a priority as caffeine is! I am a big lover of hazelnut-flavored foods, as is evidenced for my penchant for nutella, Ferrero Rocher chocolates, and hazelnut Coffeemate, so hazelnut coffee shouldn't seem like a big splurge.

391,"Also pretty!'-flavored commentary. We've been to two services so far, as I write this on Monday (6/30). I think it says something about how I approach religion that I enjoyed one so much more than the other. The first was Evensong at the king's college chapel in Cambridge. It was very much a /performance/. We had to stand and sit at the right times, and I think we got to say a couple amen's, but otherwise it just went on and on with all these fancy arrangements of the sung Psalms for the boy's and men's choir, which was all very pretty, but I'd been traveling by that point for something like 22 hours in various ways, awake for 26, and so I really, really didn't want to stand there listening when I [wanted to] lie down and have a drink because through-out this trip I've been perpetually dehydrated. It was a very /nice/ performance, but I /am/ Episcopalian in as much as I belong to any organized religion, and so this was /my/ religion, and I was essentially being forced to sit back and watch rather than being allowed to participate, which is what religion is /about/ for me.",Unfulfilled

Today work was work, and afterwards I went to the U of S to print some forms and handle a couple things online and in phonecalls. Then I went to pick up Garrett and we waited in line for what was actually a really short time to get him and Jess in a ballroom class and I got to know my instructor. We were leaving Broadway to go to 8th to eat but Garrett [wanted to] eat on Broadway, and as I was waiting to turn left across the traffic there was an accident right in front of us where a truck jammed on his brakes for no apparent reason, causing the car behind him to squeal to a stop an inch from his bumper, then the car behind them sandwiched the poor car, now in the middle, and the original truck squealed off. There were others who stopped to officially witness, so we didn't, but we were both pretty ticked at the driver of the truck. After this, we decided to go to bliss, a brand new restaurant on Broadway which Garrett was attracted to because it had crisp tablecloths and looked classy. Actually first we tried to go into a hole in the wall that advised us we needed to book way in advance to eat there. So Garret and I had a full spread of food - I had Saskatoon Berry iced Tea which was delectable, and we had an appetizer that's kind of hard to explain but it's kind of like a perogy-shaped spring roll-ish type thing with cool dipping sauces, and he had steak and I had chicken with bacon and roasted red pepper and garlic mashed potatoes, and then we had desert, and I caved and tried the chocolate, which I really didn't like much despite it being the really awesome expensive kind, and I had a creme desert with Earl Grey tea. It cost about $45 each, which for all the food we had was cheap really, and it was amazing and worthwhile.",Fulfilled
393,"It's been a good few weeks since I last updated my blog with a live session report. There are two reasons for this, first is because I have quite a few entries written about other general carp fishing stuff that I [wanted to] publish and secondly because I was invited to join a publicity shy North west carp syndicate. I dithered over taking the syndicate ticket as my own lifetime isn't long enough to fish the current waters I already have available. The Syndicate was quite close to home though and it would certainly reduce my fuel bill if I started fishing there. With this in mind I took the ticket and I've spent the last month doing short evening sessions and the odd Saturday daytime on this new water. I've had a few carp from the new syndicate but I've been less than impressed with their size, the lakes biggies had spawned successfully and as a result, the water was overrun with commons in the 2-6lb range. After 4 weeks of these small fish I decided to give the syndicate a miss for a while, it does contain some decent fish and I will visit again at some point in the future but for now I decided to head back to one of my Cheshire carp waters for my first overnighter since I tweaked an old back injury back in June.",Fulfilled

I was planning on leaving tomorrow morning, but now am going to leave Saturday morning, or maybe even Sunday morning, we'll see what happens... with D-day arriving, my urgency level has increased, and without having to wake up early for work, I can stay up later getting things together and packing.

The second place was loud and busy and we had walked there and I was coldcold and exhausted and the second we sat down I [wanted to] get back up and march myself back to my friend's place. But we stayed and waited for another friend and our ride. And we stayed. And stayed.

399,"I have to say that this was the port I was the least excited for on the entire trip, but it turned out to be better than Brazil. While staying in a hostel in the capital I was talking with a girl from Israel. She said that something is only fun if it is beautiful, adventurous, or done with people you love. Brazil was beautiful and my time in Walvis Bay could be described as nothing short of adventurous. I did not have a pre-planned trip with semester at Sea for this port so I was thinking about what I wanted to do at dinner prior to departing. I decided I [wanted to] sneak out of the country and head into Zambia and Zimbabwe to visit Victoria Falls and do some extreme sports there and camp.

It had been a couple months prior to then since I had talked to her, but I remember chatting with her about her car, what she [wanted to] do with it, how she was somewhat dismayed that it was an auto instead of manual, and even the possibility of going bowling at some point in time. She was a pretty sweet girl... which is why it shocked me even moreso that she was murdered. A victim of domestic abuse gone too far. She wasn't just killed though.

Wooing took a lot out of a man, and it was probably best to start when his energy was high.

I originally [wanted to] book Ritz Carlton since its rack rate wasn't that far off from Marina Mandarin's but it turned out that all the rooms facing the Marina were booked solid. It was quite a spectacle as we went to and fro the rooms and balconies trying to watch the ground and aerial displays on television and up in the sky respectively. The highlight of course was the fireworks; though it was spoiled somewhat by the lingering smoke after every burst, due to the windless surrounding. Let's face it, the whole National Day spectacle is one major propaganda drumming up racial harmony and equality, that's hardly believable in reality. But rather than hear citizens' tax money go up in smoke through bad overseas investments, I'd rather watch it burnt literally in full splendour through fireworks. The next day, we checked out of Marina Mandarin and headed across the road to the Conrad Centennial Singapore where I had booked business floor rooms for the night, due to the attractive package they were offering for the national Day long weekend.",Unfulfilled

I started to come up with some ideas and whenever I did, I would bring them to Steve, who would somehow help me to explore my thoughts and make my idea even better. I started writing business plans, mapping out ideas, and researching what services did, and did not exist for my target market. Frank was very discouraging. As he watched me exploring ideas, he could see that I had started living a life that he was not a part of. His jealousy and sense of loss triggered his anger as he began putting me down and trying to sabotage my efforts with his rage.",Unknown

So, we decided not to sell this place and just try to keep this property for awhile. The best reason why we [wanted to] get rid of this property is because our monthly mortgage is too much for us. Well, I guess it's not the best time to sell properties right now since real estate is down at this moment. But, on the other hand it is probably a good timing to buy properties because prices are cheaper and a lot of real estate companies are giving good deal for buyers.

One time we started with pudding, then went to his cookies (organic, cinnamon oatmeal, fortified, cookie Monster alphabet cookies that his grandma o'D gives us boxes of for him), then went to his crackers (veggie crackers), with no clean-up in between them, which means residue accumulation on his hands, on and in his mouth, and on the tray.

I am in the process of getting to where I want to be... working things out along the way... getting ideas out of my system, as it were... making the marks on cloth that I have envisioned, as I find out what I really grabs my attention and holds it. I have already discovered that I am far more intrigued with organic, seemingly uncontrolled designs than I had previously imagined. I am drawn to and want to focus on letting the dye and paint go where they want to go instead of imposing structure and boundaries. Actually, I had an experience of this back in the early 1990s, when I ""tried"" to paint silk -- I was hoping to be able to do painterly work with gutta (resist goo) that was popular then and now. For me, it was fraught with technical difficulties, until I finally let go of what I thought I [wanted to] do, and just painted dyes on silk without expectation. This image is of a silk scarf that I dyed in 1992. I have it and two others hanging in my studio now, thinking I'll probably go further with them, finally. They feel unfinished. But they do capture what still excites me about dye on fabric, and so the feeling elicited here is what I am still aiming to achieve, now on handwoven fabric, and now with dye, paint and discharge.",Unfulfilled

I had 18 lots to sell, but one of the 2 gal bowls I brought cracked I had a lot of expensive stuff there, and altho I knew it wouldn't sell for a lot, I was expecting more than what I'm going to get.

I met an old friend, and saw that he purchased one of the 2.5G tanks, the better of the 2 that I had there: Tank, mesh lid, heater, filter, and pump. I asked him how much he paid for it, and he said $6. I about fainted. A 2.5 gal tank is the most expensive tank you can get for the size (they cost as much as a 10 gal because they aren't sold as often), and I was expecting to get at least $15 for all of that.",Unknown

628,"Last weekend I had the privilege of being the speaker for the camp held by the youth group at Northcote Baptist Church. My good friend Dale is one of the associate pastor's at the church and has the responsibility of overseeing the group, so it was he who invited me. Leading up to the camp was a relatively strange experience as I had developed a somewhat irrational phobia of standing before groups and delivering prepared talks. I think the growth of that fear had developed since my last prepared talk at my own church community (Cession) that in my eyes, had been a complete and utter disaster that had seen me unable to formulate anything worthwhile for that talk and rewriting the whole thing the Sunday I was delivering it... I know nobody else probably thought it was that bad, but it planted a rather large seed of doubt in my head as to whether such speaking was really something I [wanted to] be doing. The stress of that was immense and had left my hands shaking like a leaf for a couple of days... Yes, sometimes I can be extremely and irrationally fragile. I didn't talk to anybody about it and the seed grew and grew until I declared and made up my mind that I'm not a 'preacher'. The phobia was well and truly developed. In that time I have turned down a number of speaking engagements that probably could have been quite good.",Unfulfilled

He had been working on my Valentine's day gift for most of the day (well at least since he woke up and most of the time before he went to bed). He wanted to surprise me with flowers but he didn't have time to get the flowers and come get me. He came to get me, we went home for about an hour and decided how we [wanted to] spend our day together since RAs and Deanna [wanted to] spend their v-Day together instead of gaming - now who on earth spends their v-day with their significant other rather than gaming *Smile & wink*? So Chris and I decided to go out to dinner at Olive Garden - it was packed! We were lucky and got there before 5 so we only waited maybe 20 minutes. We shared our dinners as always and we split a dessert - something like a lava cake with strawberries and a vanilla sauce it was soo good! After dinner we went over to Barnes & Nobles where Chris bought the first Lorwyn book and a manga and I bought two manga and vampire the Requiem RPG using my Christmas gift card. We then went to price Chopper so Chris could get me my flowers and we spent the rest of the night spending quality time together.",Fulfilled

He did fabulous, knocked one bar, but was because I made too much noise while he was jumping. Other than that, he read all the turns, was able to do the serp while I ran, and was all together fun to run. Mayzie wasn't really ready for the entire course, so we did pieces of it.

Instead of wishing away nine months of pregnancy and complaining about the shadow over my feet, I would cherish every minute of it and realized that the wonderment growing inside me was to be my only chance in life to assist God in a miracle. If I had my life to live over again I would have never have insisted the car windows be rolled up on a summer day because I [wanted to] stay cooler. I would have invited friends over to dinner even if the carpet was stained and my kitchen cabinets were extremely awful. I would have never bought the tortoise at Christmas. I would have eaten popcorn in the good living room and worried less about the dirt when I lit the fireplace. I would have ridden my bike more.

And it's my mom's bday- we went together on a digital camera (brother, sister and I). Fortunately I did a little camera shopping for a certain person earlier in the summer so I found it a little easier than expected to find a camera in our price range that was good quality.

""With glowing hearts"" was one of them so I kind of figured that although the media is sometimes wrong when reporting the facts, that sometimes their hunch is accurate. The boss thought ""celebrate the possible"" was the slogan. I never thought about that as a slogan, but the more I thought about it, it was a really good slogan if that was used. ""Celebrate the possibilties"" or ""Celebrate the possible"" both sounded great. But now the 2010 slogan was unveiled, I understand it.

All in pinks, purples and colors that fall appropriately along the spectrum. She then drew a grid to show the size of the individual fabric squares that would go in her first block. I cut the fabric I am not comfortable letting a child - ok anyone - use my Rotary cutter. Then she arranged the fabrics in a pattern that pleased her, and we sewed the pieces together.",Fulfilled

834,"I watched Senator Obama's speech not too long ago on MSNBC. I have to admit... I agreed with everything he said. I liked how he said that regardless what our ideologies happen to be, we have to admit certain things ie. Whether one believes in gay marriage or not, someone in a same-sex relationship should at least have the right to see their loved one while they are sick in the hospital and should be able to live without being discriminated against . You have to agree that common ground should be an understood way of doing things, not just a pipe dream. I think they said he listed 29 policies he [wanted to] take on while President. While I loved the ideas that he came up with, I'm hoping that he hasn't gotten himself in over his head or is setting himself up to have a showdown with Congress. I personally had two favorite parts in the telecast that I watched: The first was during Obama's speech. I loved his reference to the American spirit and promise. He's right... somewhere along the way, we've put those things in a box and locked them up somewhere.",Unknown

I picked my very pregnant sister, Michelle, up at 9am to go to her doctor appointment since today was her due date. We were both pretty chilled because at her last appointment the doctor said it would probably be a while till Peter was ready to be born, so we went into the appointment thinking it was just a checkup... and walked out with a totally different agenda. Her doctor [wanted to] do an ultrasound since he was due today and was showing no real natural signs of wanting to be born and join us. He was quite content in his little cocoon. During the ultrasound, the doctor noticed that there was some dark and murky stuff in the amniotic fluid, and it looked a bit disturbing to her. She believed it was meconium (for those not fluent in baby lingo, it's a fancy doctor word for baby poo) and was worried about the baby suffering from meconium aspiration syndrome.

Kumoricon and I have a long history when Kumoricon first came to Portland I was there and that was 5 years ago. The convention was only a year old then and it was doubled in size and experience. I didn't have much money but I did get introduced to Pockey & Ramune that is what I lived on while I was there at the Marriott on the water front. After meeting some friends we took over an video room and played videos that we [wanted to] watch and I got to crash in someones room and that really saved me. While I was there I decided to volunteer and I enjoyed it so much that the next year I volunteered the entire con. Then I became staff and worked as manager contacting other conventions and setting up local events to promote Kumoricon and I created the idea of having a chibi version of the Kumoricon mascot. When I was diagnosed with cancer and then had surgery I still attended and volunteered last year. This year ofcourse I am attending as the official photographer and that will be fun as it will be adding to my business experience plus I can give back to Kumoricon. Hope to see you there.,Fulfilled

Personally, I am fancy about the international Relations, but what ir is all about is making a better world. Then regardless of the argy-bagy, whether it is possible, whether it is needed, whether it is hard, I settle the sail with the change we can believe in, I stretch my life with an end to aim at. At the stage, I am not in a position to lift people out of poverty, not to sustain the peace and prosperity, but I am firmly able to make our student experience here richer and sweeter.",Fulfilled

Friday night I [wanted to] go up to Auburn to see Jake play in his band competition so Jordan came to pick me up so we could go together. I grabbed all my stuff and got in the car and we took off. Like 2 mins out of town I look around, I'm in the back seat next to a baby seat, so stuff doesn't really get shifted around too much. But for some reason I can't find my stuff. I looked on the floor, on both sides next to me, under my sweater, in my sweater, in the little pocket part on the door even and I just can't find it. So I start thinking maybe I set it down in the house when I went to pick up the water bottle.",Fulfilled

876,"I could kick myself, cos I'd looked in there twice to check the pressure on the boiler to determine if it was a mains water or Central heating leak, and not noticed - it wasn't visible, but blindingly obvious directly you touched the sheets. Now I have a bath full of soaking towels, sheets and spare quilts. On investigation it looks like the main leak is on the cold fill to the heater tank internal to the boiler, but the joint on the condensate pipe (output from the boiler) is also leaking and the pipe away from the condensate pump was pinched, due to mis-installation and had caused the small tank around the pump to fill up, so three problems in total. On the strength of that British Gas has again been called and a new engineer demanded of them, much to their indignation. He's been promised before 6pm tonight. Luckily I remembered there was a separate stop-cock for the boiler, so cold water has been restored to the rest of the house - just no hot water and no Central heating... although I think the central heating is probably ok, if I [wanted to] risk turning the power back on to the boiler, because I think it's a sealed system and doesn't actually have mains connected, except when being filled/serviced. I'm sure they'll complain about the fact that Mike has taken the front cover off the boiler so we could identify the location of the leak.",Unknown

914,"I've been in a rather nostalgic mood lately. I'm not really sure why, but I've been once again reading back through my own livejournal and some of my friends' livejournals. I think it's good to remember where you've been, it helps you see how far you've come and also how your path has twisted and turned over the years. So yesterday I was reading back through Michelle's livejournal, skipping randomly to different years and reading random entries, and I came across a really long survey that I had apparently filled out in my own livejournal and she had then filled it out in hers. I kind of [wanted to] do it again, because reading through it, I realized that a lot of my answers had changed, especially the questions about things I've done or not done. But for now, I've decided not to do it yet (although it may yet make an appearance later in this entry, haha). Lately I've started to re-enter the land of a thousand Countdowns (haha), trying to break up longer countdowns by filling the time in between with shorter ones. The latest one I've started is that Marcus and I finally were able to plan ourselves a little mini-vacation! We will be going up to the DC area the second weekend in August (Marcus has a 3-day weekend and I'm taking off that Friday from work), using my parents' house as a home base and spending a day at Rehoboth Beach and another day at Kings Dominion with Michelle. I'm so excited and honestly relieved that I will get to go to the beach this summer after all.",Unfulfilled

I had just started sims and I [wanted to] play, but you were making me feel so good with your touch that I couldn't leave your side for something so trivial. I was relaxing and letting go of myself; I was falling into my pet role. Then you grabbed me by my hair and I though, 'you are such a cave man!' You drug me, pulling at my scalp by my hair and I struggled to keep pace with you on my hands and knees across the living room and into the bedroom where you pulled me half onto the bed so my ass was exposed to you. I was conflicted between feeling used (because we have been so vanilla lately) and feeling like you were base, crude, and uncreative and being turned on by the brute force you were using. My mind was reeling. I was thinking about maybe how men and women had sex before there was civilization.",Unfulfilled

And she was like ""why is that?"" and I was just like ""I just dont"". But I know the reason is because no one likes me enough to actually wanna spend time with me.

Since they didn't finish until 3 pm on Monday, we couldn't drive very far that day, and we definitely [wanted to] move on, since we had stayed much longer in NM than expected. We made it to Tucumcari, NM (almost to the border of NM and Texas), and stayed for the night there.

922,"So today was a rush of emotions and finalities and things finally spoken that had so long been left unsaid. It's funny the past few days if not longer I was struggling within myself to feel like I deserved to be loved or that I was even capable of being loved by someone without there being some sort of darkness looming around the relationship just waiting to strike at any given time to bring the world as I knew it crashing down into little bits of self doubt and ugliness. Anyway, the point is, last night was the last night I told myself I was going to allow myself to be consumed by those feelings, that's why the blog, that's why I was trying to put a little space between that feeling and reality. So it's funny to me that as soon as I made that conscious choice to move on, today is the day that I have the means to finally say what I had been wanting to for so long even though it goes against who I am and what I am comfortable saying. I am sort of glad for that blog and the uneasiness I had been feeling because if I hadn't had that I don't think I would have said anything to him. I think that I would have just looked at him and let him say what he [wanted to] say and probably just cried and felt more hurt and more self doubt. I am so proud of myself that I didn't cry nor get teary eyed, this surprised me as I have been a walking ball of emotions since I got down here. It's funny how things work out, life has a way of doing that, to keep moving even if you aren't always ready for it to, but today was one of those days where fate aligned just right and I had come to a place where I felt strong enough to stand up for the past and to just lay it on the line.",Unfulfilled

DD Anyway, my grandmother sent him like $50.00 for his birthday, since she had no clue what to get him and she didn't want him feeling ""left out"" since I got like... $100.00 for my own birthday. He didn't really want to spend it, but I kinda forced my parents into letting him have it to himself, since he gets like... NONE of the money he brings into the house to himself either. I asked him what he wanted with it, since he was working when we were going to Wal*Mart, and he basically stared at me with this clueless look on his face...",Unfulfilled

He is the first person in the history of my family on both my moms side and my dads side to have cancer (we have good genes) So the whole trip I was holding back tears because I hate crying especially in front of ppl (I don't think anyone really likes crying). So when I get to the house everyone starts commenting on how thin I looked and they were shoving food in my face, I felt so disgusted I wanted to leave as soon as I got there. My bfs sister asked if I could run to the store to grab more plastic forks and some more coolers and I was out the door before she could even hand me the money for them, I needed to get out of there. When I get back, theres a plate with a burger on it that someone had set aside for me so I cut it in half and started eating, it felt like everyone was watching, I [wanted to] spit everything on my plate and get in the car and leave, but I didn't, I ate probably, 3/4 of the burger, I felt sick to my stomach, I told my bf that I had to go home, I felt so uncomfortable there. When we were saying our goodbyes, one of our family friends insisted that we take home some of the cupcakes she made since we were leaving before dessert was brought out, she handed me a paper towel with 2 cupcakes inside. I held them for about half the car ride before I ate one: Now I feel even worse.",Unfulfilled

I got home from uni after the lecture today and had to go to work straight away, but all I [wanted to] do was read. That's a little different for me but it is really good!

As it is, Sally is kinda sorta another kid, and Jo was missing her anyway, and much to the chargrin of her hugely ugly kitten, Sally stayed with her for a week. Once the mutt was delivered, I had to lug my crap back to town for the bus, and then endue rush hour with every plank, numpty and utter moron heading in the same direction as me. The journey usually takes me 30 minutes, maybe 40 on a busy day. This trip took an hour. An hour, surrounded by ""people"" that I [wanted to] eject from the bus.

My strong point is generating a thousand ideas, starting a zillion new files, and then leaving the concepts undeveloped on the backburner. My strong point is working on a hundred things at one time, putting in a day or a minute here and there. Eventually, you get something. But imagine if I focused on one at A TIME! Partly because I needed some excitement in my less and less exciting life, partly because I [wanted to] practice my focusing techniques, and partly because I [wanted to] avoid the holiday weekend excesses for which I have a penchant, I entered the three Day novel contest.

I soo wanted the day to be perfect. I wanted the girls to look like Christmas angels in their red and black plaid dresses, (and act like angles too) and I [wanted to] get the perfect photo of all the children under a beautiful tree, or maybe even an family photo since we were all dressed up.

There were times when I really [wanted to] quit my job or just compromise on my school assignments. But looking ahead and above, I know there's much more that I can handle than simply just giving up.

Then I told myself to relax, that numbers are a huge part of our lives. In the card sample that I created, I [wanted to] use the Applegate family from retro Cafe Art Gallery. I thought about these siblings and how they would grow up together, how the older daughter would look after her younger siblings, how they would go to school and play games together and how their mother might mark their growth on a chart or perhaps on the frame of a door... and how each of these events involved numbers in some way. You want to sit outside, but they're all inside and they know better. The light starts to look strange, but it's okay.

Through a friend of ours, he learned my cell phone number and started texting me on September 12, 2007. And at that time, I decided that I finally [wanted to] open my heart again. And I was so glad I did! He turned out to be everything I was looking for and a million times more than I deserved. He listened to me and really thought about what I said even if he was just texting me.

The autorickshaw driver who drove me back from Vipassana - Rajeet - has stuck himself to my side, which (from my previous experience in Jaipur in February 2006 with 'Jimmy') is the modus operandi of autorickshaw drivers. Which worked okay with me because organisational e kicked in yesterday afternoon and I had a list (yes, even in India I write lists) of things I [wanted to] do, and he happily drove me everywhere I needed to go. I have organised an overnight bus to Udaipur tonight, and a flight from Udaipur to Delhi on 17 September. I think today may be the 12th (and not yesterday as per my previous confused blog), which means I'll have a few days to check out Udaipur. Next on my list of things to do yesterday was to get an ayuvedic massage - my neck is officially f*&ked c/- the whole 10 hours meditation.

1007,"68 The missing book 1: Found by Margaret Peterson Haddix it seems about every 6th grader I teach is reading this book right now. Our librarian showed a preview video for our scholastic book Fair and this book was part of that video. It played just like a movie trailer and really drew the kids into the mystery of the story - myself included. So I decided that I really [wanted to] read this book because I was so intrigued by the preview, and I have to say that it didn't disappoint me - up until the last third of the book. The story was riveting and suspenseful and I love how Haddix always left the reader hanging at the end of each chapter to make you want to keep reading. But from the climax to the end however, the story just felt really forced. I really think that Haddix should've worked out the ending for this story before she started writing it. I understand that some books are written without the author knowing how it will end before he/she starts, but given the element of science fiction in this novel, she really needed to work out that ending before she got too involved in writing the story. Because she appeared to write as she went, the climax, falling action, and resolution really felt like she rushed through it and didn't put much time or thought into it.",Fulfilled

I applied three coats of gesso (it dries very quickly), then pulled off the tape and applied three coats to the other side.

It seemed like a pretty good idea overall- not having to worry about having the bookshelf space to store things would be nice, having all the books on the device so I could go back and check something if I [wanted to] (seeing as how most of what I've read over the last few years have been from one author/series... ), and not having to worry about how to hold the book open while I was eating. However, on the down-sides it's not cheap, it's purely black-and-white making true magazines on it impossible, and- in spite of the fact they do have a lot- there is still a fair bit that you can't get for it including the one paper I'd seriously consider a subscription for on it as well as the fact there isn't any manga that I've seen... . Were they to come out with one that had color digital paper and was of a high enough resolution to display magazines, comics, and manga well for a decent price as well as expanding out the subscription selection, and I might consider it. But for now, it's an interesting proof-of-concept that I'm just not up for being an early adopter of. However, the idea of being able to do away somewhat with carrying books around is still rather appealing- so when I bought the iPhone, one of the first things I did was to look through the selection of electronic book reader applications for it and snag one to try and see if it could be used as a viable electronic book reader.

I also got up to this one with no problems. Later in the day I took a 20 minute nap and a 1 hour nap, and got up to the alarm both times without incident. I am surprised at how easily this experiment has gone. I went from oversleeping every single day to getting up at my alarm, without fail.

All six products tested gave off at least one chemical regulated as toxic or hazardous under federal laws, but none of those chemicals was listed on the product labels. ""I first got interested in this topic because people were telling me that the air fresheners in public restrooms and the scent from laundry products vented outdoors were making them sick,"" said Dr. Steinemann, ""and I [wanted to] know, 'What's in these products that is causing these effects?'"" Well, now it makes a lot more sense that I am badly affected by walking down the laundry detergent aisle in a typical grocery store. About 10-15 feet into the aisle, it feels like a spike has been pounded into my head. It doesn't go away when I leave the aisle. Now, there is some indication as to why this happens.

She still isn't 100%, or near 100%, but the pediatrician and the doctor at the hospital kind of let me decide if we [wanted to] be admitted to medicine or give it a go at home. Our pediatrician is on call this weekend, so if we have to go back in because she still isn't eating or drinking (which is her current stance on the issue), it will be an easy process. But, KayTar is ahead of the game because they pumped her full of fluids for over 24 hours, so we have a little leeway if she keeps refusing, at least enough time for a shower and a night in our own beds. So I said, ""YES please!"" because it is my birthday and at that point the only thing I wanted was to be in clothes that hadn't been puked on yet, unlike the ones I had been wearing for well over 24 hours. Actually, that isn't really true, pukey clothes and all, it was kind of an agonizing decision to make and I hope I made the right one for her. I'm still pretty worried about how tonight and tomorrow are going to go, worried about the possibility of a return to the hospital.",Fulfilled

We got talking and decided to go for a coffee together before registration began, so the day got off to a good start. The induction didn't last nearly as long as we were told it would - the head of the course seems like a very nice guy, the other lecturer, well, didn't so much, but we'll see. I really should be pleased that I got into the class at all - 200 people applied for the course and only 30 people got in, so the majority of people who applied got turned away. I should be happy about that! Maurice, the tutor, told us that not only had the college [wanted to] get rid of the direct debit facility, they had also [wanted to] double the course fees just three weeks before the course began. It was the tutors and lecturers who managed to convince the college that was a pretty bad idea, but it will take effect from next year. Good thing I applied when I did...",Unfulfilled

Had a good start to the festival me and Matt drove up thou we did get there a little later then I would've liked the spot where I wanted to camp was already quite full but I found a spot with a space for Adam & Hannah when they arrived later. After setting up I gave Matt a little tour of the site pointing out the best places to go, but unfortunately the tour would continue for many days as instead of doing his own thing Matt mostly followed me to the music I wanted to see and the places I wanted to eat, except for an unnatural hatred for the Wurzels by Matt, but he did do some things on his own, like going to the toilet. A good example was Thursday night, I [wanted to] go see back to the future in the cinema field even though it was raining, Matt didn't want to go because it was raining, so I was all prepared with plenty of waterproofing and went to watch the film a little while later Matt shows up with his chair and not much else which led to him getting very cold and soggy and leaving before it finished, Adam told me later that Matt had a complete change of heart and decided it wasn't too wet to watch a film despite his previous complaints.

We arrived at the library ten minutes earlier, with nothing to do, so I went to the children's section to entertain myself with a book, while my dad went up to the adult's section to look at fishing magazines. About five minutes later, I spotted my biological mum from a distance. I stared at her, but did not make any move or attempt to wave at her. I watched her draw nearer and nearer, step by step, and heard the clicking of her heels grow louder and louder as she took one more step towards me. My heart was pounding because I have not seen that woman for so long, and I did not know the reason why she [wanted to] meet up with me so suddenly.

I got to capture some hilarious footage of us singing on the car ride up and back, and thank God for those good times because the actually time spent outside of the car was more like a mini-drama episode where someone comes along on a trip and isn't really welcomed by the boyfriend's long time friend. I was quiet, was more worried about not upsetting anyone than making a friend, but I survived. The goodbye was the worst and most memorable part since it's a little hard to forget when someone is bringing down the death-gaze on you.

Embracing new styles of singing and playing, a previously unexplored level of melodicism and a genre-shattering range of instrumentation - including Turkish saz, trumpets, strings, piano, Opera vocals and pedal steel guitar - Atreyu have created an exultant disc that expands the parameters of heavy music and unabashedly exposes the band members' love of '80s metal, thrash, industrial, hardcore, alternative and even alt-country. At the same time, Atreyu have written some of the heaviest, most brutal tracks of their career. ""Can't happen Here"" starts with the sound of machine guns, helicopters and screaming children, then breaks into a marching snare beat before bursting into a melodic mix of raging vocals, abrupt rhythmic shifts and a trademark Atreyu monster hook refrain.

For one thing I was permitted to set up a corral for my horses in a area directly behind the temple that contained some short, sparse grass. I was made to understand that the arrangement could not be permanent unless I [wanted to] purchase the vacant Manor that was next to this grassy area. While the Manor was lovely, it was beyond what I was able to afford at that time. I had just made sure that the horses and donkey were comfortable when I was approached by Braynas Hlervu. When I handed him the green gem that I had taken from the Daedric shrine, Braynas said with admiration in his voice, Thank you. Yes, this emerald seems to be cursed.

We decided well before Ike that given the choice between staying in a new-construction house during a direct hit from a cat-2 or being potentially immobilized on the highway with several thousand of our neighbors, it is not much of a choice. The City has done its best to learn some lessons from Rita, and more will be learned from Ike. This time evacuations were targeted to areas that were truly at risk, and everyone else was asked to consider staying home. Sustained winds of 80-85 mph were forecast for our zip code, which is not enough to cause structural damage. We expected that we might lose some windows and we knew we would likely be without power, possibly for weeks, but we didn't know what to expect from the neighborhood and [wanted to] be here to defend against potential looting. In fact, we didn't lose a single window.

I wasn't very impressed when my suitcase wasn't in my room as promised after the first day of the conference, and had to call down, then wait 20 minutes, for someone to bring it up to me. At least my room was nice - big kingsize bed, couch, view of the city and flatscreen TV which has speakers in the bathroom - which was great when I needed to get ready but still [wanted to] 'listen' to South Park! Although the education level was appropriate, and most sessions were interesting, I still did not enjoy myself.

I told her she didn't have to, and that I didn't deserve it, but she thrust money in my hand, thanked me for my service and then took off. She was on the verge of tears. When I looked at the money, she had given me 40 dollars... way more than neccessary. If you believe in prayer, I'd like to ask you to pray for her. At the least, keep her in your thoughts as you go about your day.",Fulfilled

Although there was little wind, the heavy cloud was of the sort that could have produced a sharp shower at ten minute intervals, or persistent rain, and the cloud cover was almost complete. Despite this, by late morning it felt as if it might stay dry. This was confirmed by the weather forecast for Cardiff so I decided to take a chance on a short ride after lunch. It had to be a short ride because I hadn't been out for a few weeks and had no idea how unfit I had become. Besides, I [wanted to] do some painting in the afternoon while there was some daylight still. So I chose a familiar route of just about two miles, most of it being uphill, and with a couple of short, sharp descents towards the end. It is a great feeling when the confidence returns as soon as the wheels start turning.",Unknown

Although it was further away from our church, we wanted to pay a visit because we at least, know ppl there. In our previous church, we have a family room that is kinda of secluded from the rest of the congregation so for the lst 3 mths, we have always brought Seth into the room and attended service that way. We could have left him in the nursery and actually I had [wanted to] do so but mark didnt think that it would be safe for Seth to be left in there with the other babies at such a young age. And to be honest, I am a bit possessive so when Mark hesistated, I didnt push him. This church is kinda different. There is no separated room in the main hall and although, you can bring your child into the service, most of the congregation leave their children to the various children Sunday schools. Since we were new and visiting, I decided to bring Seth along and all was great and dandy until he started talking during preaching. He started off slow and quiet then it got louder and it was like he was critiquing the pastor.",Unfulfilled

This is why I was very upset that the weather was not cooperating. It rained hard Friday and Saturday. It drizzled this morning with more rain threatening any second but I wanted to go the apple festival so Rob and I braved the elements.

Yuck) but the actual rain held off long enough for us to wander the festival for about two hours.

1468,Here is a list of 100 things that you may or may not have known about me: 1. I [wanted to] be a pastry chef when I grew up between 5-7th grade. 2. I know how to make stained glass windows. 3. I made a stained glass duck in 7th grade that won 1st place in the Washington County Fair. 4. I got a stereo for my 13th birthday from my grandparents.

AZ (the blonde in the pic below) and I had both of our student Teaching placements at the same schools so we got to carpool together. Here we are at our second placement - a fantastic, brand-new arts focused public elementary school. Our 2 classes got together to have a farewell party for us when we left. There was a waiting list of teachers who [wanted to] teach here, but we were hired on as brand new teachers right away since we'd done our student Teaching placement there and they knew us. What a blessing!!! We were signed on as 3rd grade teachers... the perfect grade! There was another opening on our team, and our college friend a got it!

I've been writing since I was eight or nine, mostly because a friend of the family suggested I write a short story when we were on a family vacation and I was bored and bothering everyone. I was hooked right away and kept writing, reams of really bad poetry in high school and short stories and a handwritten fantasy novel best left undescribed. I started to send out my work when I was around 15, not because I thought I'd get pubished but because I wanted the practice and [wanted to] get used to rejection, which we know, is a big part of this writing gig. Have I mentioned stubborness is not something I lack? My first published pieces were all poems (On spec, room of One's own and similar mags)--oh and incidentally, Tesseracts 11 is now available with my poem ""little red"", which is a little red riding hood retelling. Anyway, for a couple of years I got the 'good' rejections, the ones that say 'this is isn't right for us but we like your style, send us more . So I wrote and I wrote and I sent and I wrote and repeat as needed. Finally in 2006 Orca published my first novel, a young Adult modern fairy tale (Sleeping beauty) called 'Waking'.

First, as the Warnings say, this fic contains a spoiler for the middle section of Los. You'll know it when you see it.

1561,"According to a Harvard Medical School study, ""yoga and meditation practices are effective in stress management, alleviating anxiety and musculoskeletal problems and improving mood."" But yoga is also athletic and carries with it many of the same risks of injury as do sports such as skiing and soccer. Those risks may even be higher because yoga practitioners, intent on focusing on their poses, may fail to pick up on warning signs of an injury. Or, like me, they just want to push themselves harder. I felt my knee was going to pop every time I did a pose called ""half-bound forward lotus fold,"" in which the knee is bent and rotated to the side, I kept on doing the pose. My body was trying to tell me something, but I [wanted to] push myself. Common injuries to the knees are among the most common in yoga. ""With the knee, you must watch poses that incorporate extreme bending or rotation, especially when those movements are combined,"" says Jardine. ""The knee is basically two bones sitting on top of each other; it's good for mobility, but not for strength or stability."" Poses that incorporate the half or full lotus cross-legged position, or those such as the revolved side angle pose, where the knee is bent and rotated and taking some of the body's weight, are particularly hard on knees. In addition to the knee, injuries to the back and wrists are also common in yoga. Poses that fully extend the back, such as the full upward bow, can cause disc problems, while wrists are vulnerable in weight-bearing postures such as the downward dog (hands and feet on the ground with legs straight and bum in the air) and plank (pushup position with straight arms and legs).",Fulfilled

So, I made a list of things I haven't done yet, planned when I think I'll do it, and set out for today's plan. First stop: Andreotti's. The prices for dinner are pretty steep at $20-30 per entree, so I was hoping to find that lunch was a bit more affordable and available for carry out (I can't stand to eat alone in nice restaurants). Unfortunately, the menu appears to be completely different at lunch without the Italian fare I [wanted to] try there. So, I skipped it. Second stop: Madame Tussaud's at the Venetian. Despite the Venetian's track record for having small attractions with inflated admission prices, I'd heard good things about Madame Tussaud's wax museum overall.

1563,"GoToMeeting we tried GoToMeeting to meet with some of our top donors in order to review our quarterly reports and let them know how their donations are being spent and looking for feedback from them. Normally this entails many phone calls and emails over the course of a month. This made the choice to try GoToMeeting easy but the big question was ""How easy will it be for our donors to join in from home?"". Many of them are senior citizens and only half of them had microphones readily available at their PC's so we opted to use a phone conference in conjunction with the meeting as opposed to using the VoIP that comes with GoToMeeting (participants who [wanted to] speak would need to have a microphone on their PC and as I said some of them could not find their microphones.) We sent everyone their meeting invitations by email and made sure that they received it. When it came time for the meeting all of them were connected and signed in without a problem. One person had trouble joining the phone conference and we walked them through it via a quick chat in the GoToMeeting interface.

So I was already just working on one ovary - which if you ask me, was fairly finicky on its own. When I got married we started trying for a baby right away. We knew these things took time sometimes - and with the worry that my cancer could return (it often does with the type I had) we [wanted to] make sure we had our baby together before I lost my fertility all together. After charting, temping and spitting on a scope for 4 mths and seeing clearly that I was not ovulating and the one time I did - it wasn't strong - I saw my doctor. They decided that given my history that they would be a bit more aggresive with me even though most times they make you wait a year of no baby first. I did one round of clomid and decided that the 5 days of mood swings,headaches and pain was not for me. Hubby and I prayed about it and really felt strongly that God was in control of this situation and would make things happen when he was ready.

There was a chip in my head to prevent me from using my powers except when they allowed it, and a bomb around my neck to prevent me from expelling the chip when I had my powers.

I came right to the very last column, dated 12/31/06 when a guy happened to walk by and asked me, ""Is that a good book?"" I said yes, and he ended up sitting down and talking to me for a while about it.

All were in town for the time and [wanted to] find out where to go next since the bar we were at closes at 1 am. The Italians jump in their car and drive off a bit down the road before they decide to make a ""u"" turn and ask for my friend, the Canadian, and I to jump in. My friend hesitated and didn't want to go, but I said, ""Jump in, what can it hurt?"" Off we go to another bar, where my friend decides to play pool with the Italians while I play some video games. At the end of the night, and once my friend sees that the Canadian has set his eyes on somebody else, the Italian tourists take us back to the original bar where my friend and I are able to walk to his car. Now this car is one of the oldest most beat-up cars in Boston, and I totally love it -reminds me of being a teenager in Los Angeles and riding around in cars with friends and having fun as we listen to music.",Fulfilled

Potosi was built on the riches from the mine which the Spanish discovered in the middle of the 16th century. At one point Potosi was the largest city in the Americas based on this mining wealth but the associated human cost was infeasibly large with an estimated 8 million people thought to have died there, mostly through getting silicosis from breathing in the noxious dust and fumes down the mine.

In Amsterdam, the long wait wasn't that bad; the airport itself is quite cool, with plenty of shops and restaurants and places to rest. I only had some trouble finding a convenient place to plug my laptop in (and I still dislike the fact that in most airports there is no free wireless internet, while here in Ecuador -""3rd world country""- you do get it for free in the waiting lounges). Oh, there was also another thing I [wanted to] point out: They have doubled security procedures in that airport to the point that you are checked again right before boarding the plane, which means that the sitting places before the gate have been cut down to a half, to give room for the X-ray machines and metal detectors and some additional right-before-boarding seating. That was absolutely not cool, since the amount of seats they left in the ""not safe zone"" are barely enough to seat one third or so from the whole passengers of the aircraft, meaning that the rest would have to find a place to rest in some other corner of the airport.

When I bought an SUV last Sunday, I knew it was going to be a matter of days. I thought to put my Corolla on craigslist and catch a few dollars before leaving but for 2 days I had a couple of no-shows so I decided to forget about it and leave it in the garage and deal with it when I come back. I [wanted to] have a good night sleep Friday night and so I took a sleeping pill, something I rarely do and what do you know, I was so tired the next morning and so I had to stick around the apartment for a bit to make sure that I was awake enough for the drive. I decided to drive to Winnamucca, nv and the first night in our car, see how it feels and now I know... Johannah is the best co-pilot, keeping me company in the passenger seat (sleeping a lot too) The drive to Reno is nothing knew, done that before. And since I left later then planned, the last 2 hours were in the dark, the wind was blowing big time in the desert.

I spent the evening with him on Monday and then all week we talked on the phone and Thursday and Friday night he spent the night. He had to leave today which sucks because I wanted him to stay longer but I'll see him soon ^.^. So if you haven't got the hint yet, were dating. I [wanted to] take things slow this time instead of having a complete relationship with someone because of past experiences. So Thursday was awesome!

Yeah, it's been nearly five years. I contributed to the Memorial issue for Josh in October 2003, then cayenne and I collaborated on the tribute fanfic that ran the following month, and by January 2004 I was a full-timer, contributing at least one item each month. During my tenure with the 'zine, I've seen it go from a booming, Redwall-centric cyberpublication with a staff so large and established that many times during my first year I felt a bit like an outsider, seldom consulted as to the 'zine's overall direction and identity, to those lean ratty issues when it seemed like Fwirl, Shytalon (aka Tiberuvsky) and myself were the only regular writers, to today, when we're now known as Firebird and we're no longer a Redwall 'zine per se.

This week was expensive though cause I was close to running out of most of my cleaning items and had to replace them all. Its ok when you run out of 1 or 2 things but when its all at the same time thats bad. I thought on the way home after what it cost I should buy one product each fortnight when I do my shopping and get a stock up so I wont end up needing to buy them all at once again. Went to spotlight to look at the curtains but didnt like the colours of the ones on sale and the others were too much, maybe not for some but I dont like to pay too much for anything. Listened to the radio on the way down and liked some of the music playing and thought I might buy some more CDs but the store where I used to buy them was closed down, could have looked for another but I dont like large shopping centres and just [wanted to] get out of there as fast as I could. At least that saved me some money, I was actually pleased about that on the drive home. I get bored and spending money that you dont have is not a good idea. Might feel good at the time but then reality sets in and I think that was a mistake. Probably the same with the curtains, im thinking while I am writing this.

Nothing could make this better except if I could go see my family when I [wanted to] talk to them instead of just being able to call them when I want to talk to them. That's a kind of purgatory. Also not making me happy is the whole speech class thing. It's stressful and I don't like stress, it makes me break out and it makes me have ailments that aren't going to surface until I'm 40.

When we finally hung up, I had [wanted to] get up since I didn't feel like retiring yet, but my body was really tired, so I just closed my eyes and waited for sleep. I started hearing things like random clangs and unidentifiable noises that coalesced into spurts of music so reality-jarring that I could actually hum the melodies in my head. To be quite honest, I was a bit frightened for a while, when disembodied voices started to sound more sinister; when I'd mistake streaks of black in the corner of my eyes, or the swirling spots and colors behind my eyelids, for deathly apparitions. I became immersed in the state of mind that proliferated these auditory hallucinations, listening intently, focusing on truly perceiving these aural manifestations of my mind. I ""came to"" upon hearing myself speak- a sound so solid it temporarily silenced everything else. And then I remembered that I was conversing with Jon the phone, remembered the gist of what was said, remembered the pitch of his voice; but I also remembered that we had hung up a while ago, and that my phone wasn't even on my ear.",Unfulfilled

There were horses running wild and cows grazing off the green pasture. I loved how green new Zealand is, no pollution and traffic, nature at its best.

I fell like mad, but once I got a hang of it, came the problem of stopping from a high velocity. So I just copied what others did and learn from there, it was a blast when I finally got a hang of it.

We brought in a well-known evangelist who preached mostly against the culture and things of the culture, particularly music. At the end of the week, he had what he termed an acts 19:19 party, in which he asked us to bring all our worldly CD's and possessions that were of the devil and burn them.

I checked on my experimental compost heap and it had sprouted mushrooms! Kinda neat, they're so fast. Not sure if it's because I started the pile with mushy veggies or if it's a species that just [wanted to] grow there. Either way cool but I am playing it safe and not leaving those exposed in case somebody with four legs gets curious enough to get past my barriers. Dumped the week's leavings (mainly coffee grounds, banana peels, and paper towels used to clean up food) on it, and decided to cover it with the straw from the pile to insulate it from outsiders and potentially increase the goings on. In moving the pile, I discovered a world. Not since my first time lifting a rock was I so enthralled. For a few minutes, I was back east, surrounded by trees and fields of tall grass.",Fulfilled

It was quite a rollercoaster. In the end, Trent dug a deep hole in the spot where Tyler wanted rainbow buried and Tyler put rainbow in the hole. He then found an interesting stick to place there to mark the spot. I think it provided him with some closure because later when it was bedtime, Tyler was joking and laughing.

1674,"Iron man 6/10 the movie, as adaptations from comics go was pretty good. What was most impressive to me was the iron Man suit and the special effects. The story was interesting until the last 1/3 of the movie when it got predictable and silly. The scene after the credits probably only has meaning for someone who is a fan and since I am not, I wasn't sure how to take it. I simply [wanted to] see the movie since it had good actors and seemed like an interesting movie. And it was except for the ending and all the product placement. Yes, the product placement in the movie was very blatant... the American cheeseburger part was lame, all the computers were of a variety that can be had by mail order only, all the cars were either Chevys, jaguars and Hummers. But don't get me wrong, I liked it as it was mindless fun. After seeing breathless by Godard, Ambersons by Welles and other high toned movies for a while, this was nice for a change. Also, the people in the theater were rather perplexing- the first person I sat in front of didn't have shoes on his feet and they dangled near my dad and I as we started to watch the movie.",Fulfilled
1675,"Well, problem maybe not so much, I've learned to deal with it - but you know what I mean. I just walked the dog and two teenagers asked me where a certain set of addresses was. I was suspicious. Especially since the street they were looking for is a busy, well known thoroughfare (they weren't on it, they were on a side street) and because they didn't know what they were looking for (a house, a building). On the other hand, I remember being a teenager and not knowing things like that which probably seemed obvious to adults. I remember, in fact, a certain 3 am drive with a creepy guy who [wanted to] fuck me, but didn't, and then dropped me off in pea-soup fog in a part of town I didn't know at all to fend for myself, only I was sure I heard him pull over and his door slam and I was convinced he was going to come after me. I ran down the street, tried to find someone awake, saw a window leaning against a house and thought about hiding behind it but couldn't stand the idea of being cornered and found, and instead I jumped two fences toward a back house in a small yard where I saw a light, only to look in and see two drunk guys passed out inside. Nonetheless, they were better than the freak in the fog, so I pounded on the door until they woke up and begged them to drive me home, having no idea in which direction I lived. Ugh.",Unfulfilled

Before I could tell her not to look, she saw the large, and very dead possum lying not more than 20 feet in front of us. I dont even have to tell you how freaked out she was. As many of you know, 29 is not an easy street to simply cross, walk 50 feet down, and cross back to the side you want to be on again, and since neither of us [wanted to] walk right past the freshly killed animal, we had to make a little detour through a field, where I nearly tripped into an ant pile the size of a large dog.

Late afternoon is usually the best time to see deer, for they tend to sleep during the day and come out to eat (my flowers, sometimes) in the evening. The doe did not run away with her baby not far behind as usual. Both the mother and her fawn merely looked at us but showed no signs of fear. As Madeline and I went down the sidewalk, though, the mother deer began to walk, even with us, the length it took to go to the end of the walk where it meets the drive. I had also brought some things with me I [wanted to] put into our older car, and even after we reached the car and I had opened the door (Madeline saying, ""I want to drive!""), the mother deer was still even with us, the fawn still grazing, alone, at the edge of the woods.

Darn SATA cables, if it isn't one thing then it is another that gets in the way of building my projects. So just for reference I went with a simple 4 port SATA card that will allow for raid, I took 2 500GB drives out of my DNS-323, and then I bought two more. My plan right now is to put 3 drives into a raid config and then leave 1 free to use for snap backups and whatever I want.

I've always [wanted to] learn sign-language and that by itself was enough to make the book interesting to me as a kid. To an adult it doesn't offer much.",Unknown

During his visit this week, one could say that we thoroughly enjoyed each other, but one night he [wanted to] try girl-on-top again.

Saturday I woke up, got my brows done, went food shopping, cleaned my apartment, went to the gym, went out to dinner, and saw the movie Hancock. Going in, I had thought I had known the premise - that Hancock was a surly superhero - but I thought he was saving people from the end of the earth. In New York.

That afternoon Sarah and I hung out before taking a nap and then going to a friend's really cool loft down in Castleberry.

Well, come to find out, that is now not true, but he is still looking to move. Now, I had to figure out whether I [wanted to] move with Joe, and also had Jeano to the mix, or put my shit in storage and stay with Sam while waiting to move to West Newbury. I chose to put my things in storage, and wait to move to West Newbury. If I went and got a place with Joe and Jeano, I'd be signed into a lease. If I did that, I wouldn't be able to move to West Newbury without having to keep paying for it. My gut is telling me to temporarily stay with Sam, put my shit in storage, and see what happens with the house in West Newbury.

My ninang is here from the USA, and she [wanted to] go last weekend. When she mentioned it, I begged if I could go, since it would probably be the first and last time I'd ever get to go to Boracay. Mom said I could, but I had to be back by today because I have my major subjects tomorrow (damn!). So I arranged it with all my teachers today, telling them that I wouldn't be in class because of a 'family affair'. If you look at it closely, it really isn't a lie.

I have never gone to the yearly event otherwise, and was more or less excited to walk around with a bunch of people who dressed in more awesome clothing than today's. There is more to say about the day than I gave credit for, so here I am, making it up to you. Little did I know, the same drama that plagued me from around this point of the summer onwards would prevent me from going with the group of friends I had thought I would be going with. Furthermore, my parents [wanted to] come too. Well, it's a free country, I guess. That, and my dress was too much barmaid and much more wench then I had imagined. The dress itself is beautiful, though it begged to show more cleavage than necessary. My boyfriend ordered it online, so there wasn't much I could do. It was Renaissance related and that was good.",Fulfilled

I was hauling you know what and was one seriously tired out camper when I was done.

1747,"I wont use the word ""called"" because I think that is confusing for some people... and I feel like it makes us sound more important than we really are. Like we are ""special chosen people whom God called"", which yes it is biblically correct because we are all chosen by God, we all have a purpose and a calling... Anyways, when we sit down and discuss the things we really feel strongly about it always comes back into our minds that it is what we stand for, what we believe in, and what God wants for us always lines us up to do something missional. We have been very frustrated as of recently because it seems that everytime we tried... something would happen. It would get shut down due to leadership difficulties, we would have marriage difficulties, and being attacked from all sides has been exhausting. So in light of what has happened over the last couple of years we truly decided we no longer [wanted to] be here. We were giving up, ""running away""... we said to ourselves that no matter where we go we would serve God, so it really didn't matter where we went.",Unknown

It was more like he told me the things he thought I [wanted to] hear - except I didn't want to hear those things, at least not coming from him.

And I hate it when Adriel wants me to show off to other people. It's so uncomfortable. I never know what to say or do and then I just look like an idiot. Adriel [wanted to] make out and I always feel uncomfortable being around so many people so whatever. He got a little gwumpy which I really didn't notice but he apologized for later. I just realized that I'm not at all as social as I used to be. I guess a lot of people have noticed. It's pretty obvious.,Unfulfilled

Sunday went to a Chinese restraunt, had very nice food, but there was so much that we took 6 boxes of food back with us! I can't really remember what else I did on that day, not a lot though. Monday Went into town and bought the latest sereis of 'My family' and my 'Stargate: Atlantis' season 4 DVDs (Woo!) I'll be watching them with my dad when I get back. I also traded in some DVDs at the market and got a CD of the 'Barenaked ladies' and the 'Exocist' DVD (Always [wanted to] see that). I then went over to my friend's house (she wasn't there still late because she works up at the stables), so my mum, her best friend and I went to the park and did some putting (we didn't get into three figures at least, but then again, we gave up counting after the second hole). Anyway, we waited for my friend to get back, and together we went to see 'Dark Knight' at the cinema. I wasn't particularly interested in seeing it, but she was, so we went. I was very good for what it was, but to be honest, it wasn't really my thing.",Unknown

Hell, I'd go on my off time to get them. While the docs are important, I wanted an excuse to drive to the city and have my gas paid for. Five hours is all I would ask. After hanging up for the last time, she told me that DHL [wanted to] send it over themselves. Something about sending it to Ohio and having it Detroit by 30 tomorrow afternoon.* Well we absolutely need those documents by 4:00 and unless they were going to send a plane and parachute it in, we weren't going to have it in time.

Whether it's giving the guy my bags at the airport or talking to the counter clerk, making the choice truly does make a difference. I can think back to standing there in the line waiting outside the airport and all I [wanted to] do is drop off my luggage and was thinking, How long do I have to wait? Why is this taking so long? But when I got up there and spoke with the person, I made the choice and it really changed the way I treated and interacted with him. By choosing to regard people as capable, creative and complete everything seems to be so much smoother and the path way just seems to open up. It really does alter my whole view of everything.

We went to dinner at one of my favorite ""local chains""-- it's a Columbia based southern cooking restaurant and has some of the best bacony-green beans I've ever had. It also has out-of-this-world fried okra, and tasty, tasty fried chicken, among other things. Tuesday was Kevin's birthday-- I had meant to get up super early and make him a breakfast that he could reheat (since he sleeps until 90 and I leave the house at 7:40)-- but for whatever reason, the dogs that usually wake me at 6am, were perfectly quiet until my alarm went off at 7am.",Unfulfilled

We ended in a shock a week ago, and I knew last night's episode would be rather dismal, but this episode was just... sad. I guess the writers just [wanted to] teach us about death. About how to tell a five-year-old about death and what it means to high schoolers and even adults. And that's fine. I think it's nice to try to do that, but I find it a little odd to do it for this show. Mainly, I'd say, my thoughts go back to season 3's ""With tired eyes, tired minds, Tired souls, we slept."" If you're unfamiliar with the episode title, this was the very emotional episode where a student comes to school with a gun, takes a room full of students hostage, and ends up shooting himself. Not only was this racked with stress, anxiety, and emotion, but you add the twist at the end where Dan shoots Keith-someone very close to our main characters.",Fulfilled

I didn't realize it then but the reason it was so good is the fact that we made it together or the fact that if we made it, it most likely meant mom was out of town and we could eat whatever we [wanted to] and didn't have to make our beds. Whether or not mom was gone cooking and talking about food has always been important to my father and I. I can't express how much those Coney sauce moments have impacted my thoughts as a chef and a son. I know there are many sons out there that have some of the same type stories, I encourage you to send in some of those stories about your fathers. Maybe it is grilling out, going to the ball game and sharing hot dogs and ice cold (fill in your beverage of choice)",Fulfilled

I don't want to think about. What I want to think about instead is how amazing last night was. By a stroke of good fortune and fantastic timing on my part, I called Ryan yesterday to ask if he [wanted to] go to the balloon Glow with me. I left an awkward voice mail, as per usual, and didn't think anything would come of it. Only, about half an hour later, Ryan called back, telling me that he was coming by to pick me up in 20 minutes and that I was to dress up, because he had two (rather expensive) tickets to the completely sold OUT Lord of the Rings symphony and that I was going with him. I'm pretty sure I squealed like the thirteen year old girl I not-so-very-secretly. Miracle of miracles, despite both of us needing to shower and make ourselves look pretty, we actually made it there on time. And, after some seriously awkward conversation with some of Ryan's old colleagues, a sip of champagne, and a slice of cake, we settled in for nearly two hours of stunning music.",Unfulfilled

We'd managed on foot for Munich and Dresden (except for out-of-town trips, of course), but Berlin is much bigger, and we made extensive use of the S- and u-Bahn. As we'd been to Berlin before (in 2002), we already had something of a feel for the place, and also [wanted to] see how it had changed in the last six years. The Brandenburg Gate had been cleaned, and the major works around the Parisier Platz end of Unter den Linden had long gone; the Bode-Museum had re-opened; the Neues museum was still closed, but looked in a much better state and seemed to be on schedule for its reopening in 2009. There's still a discernable transition from West to East, but probably only outside of the central areas. As we'd seen the Pergamonmuseum on our last trip, we skipped it: There seemed to be interminable queues there for a temporary exhibition on Babylon. We parted company on a few occasions in order to see more things in a constrained amount of time: I ventured off in particular to see the musical instrument Museum, the wall, and the Soviet war Memorial.

It's a beautiful piece of music... *_* I know my friend did a wonderful job, but hopefully my vocals didn't lower the beauty of the piece. Yesterday, I went out with another friend and, first, we went to eat gelato. I had the Horlicks (if you've never had this drink, you're missing out ) and coffee Crisp flavours. I did take a picture of it, but I'm too lazy to upload it. Then we [decided to] go see Pineapple Express, and went to another mall to check the movie times. Unfortunately, we had just missed the afternoon screening and the next one wasn't for another 3.5 hours, so we wandered around the mall, looking through the bookstore, and then going over to chapters to look at more books before we went for dinner at 6:00pm.",Unfulfilled

I was just making a quick run to Barnes & Noble between works and even though I already knew what I wanted, I [decided to] go around the other side of the store too. And there he was, studying at a table. Gosh he hasn't changed a bit. Just pick out the hair a little bit and shrink him a few inches and we could be back in Jr High. It was so good to see him- we haven't talked in months. We were a little rushed as I had originally planned on spending about 4 minutes in the store, but it was worth almost being late to work.",Fulfilled

On Monday, it was pretty warm out and I decided that it was time to get some new shoes for the warmer weather. So I hit Kohl's on my lunch hour. Thanks to watching too much ""What not to wear"", I [decided to] try something different, so I bought: And, they were fairly cheap. I've pretty much broken in the black shoes, the gold ones I have not been brave enough to wear out of the house yet. I will... Eventually.",Fulfilled

And there I see a man lying on the cement ground in a corner. Four of my co-workers were there too. It's funny how we got there before the nurses and doctors did.

1910,"Just a quick update on my life. This will be a happy post. Because I heard another word from God again... no problem is too big for us... no mountain too tall... Right now, it seems that my spiritual life is getting better. Thanks to the talk I had with my cell group leader last Saturday at night. I [decided to] be accountable to her. Most importantly, I was being encouraged by her to solve the problem I have/had(?) in constant defeat, which is having low confidence in myself, not loving myself. I was encouraged by her that she used verses to tell/ remind her so that she will be better spiritually. I was very unwilling to do it initially because I found it troublesome and not effective, but she reminded me about the verse For the word of God is living and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart. Heb4:12 I don't know why, but I was just very excited about applying the ""Twenty I cans"", God's promises when I remembered about a sermon a long time ago about this lady who felt very bad(in a sense being criticised by her employer), persisted in speaking to herself verses to counter those lies she had about herself.",Fulfilled

All the other students either live 5 minutes from school or live together in this one big building that is next door to a shopping center. Instead, I get to live in this dorm building by myself where I know no one, and is 2 miles from campus and almost a mile from a grocery store. This morning I went grocery shopping and almost got lost because I didn't think it'd be that far (also, I was pretty surprised when I had to pay for plastic bags). Then I [decided to] walk from my building to the school so that I could familiarize myself with the campus. I walked pretty far and thought I was pretty near.

While at the apt I had a white Russian and 2 beers. We then [decided to] go to a bar (around 120 maybe), where we met my friend Alan (down from DC) and one of his friends. Grady bought me a long Island Ice Tea, Tom said we were going to a different place... and that's all I remember. The next thing I remember is sitting on a curb and two Indian guys asking if I'm okay. I'm barefoot with nothing except chapstick in my pocket. The Indian guys paid for me to take a cab to my apt.

""Buffy"" our buff Orpington, was out roaming with the rest of the flock, when she suddenly ran back into the coop and settled down under the next box. I think we startled her because she started to run back out into the yard then quickly changed her mind (much like a person deciding that, no, they really [couldn't wait to] use the bathroom) and she scuttled back in. A half hour later I checked in on her again. She puffed up real big and I heard a small ""plop"" sound.",Unknown

I just [couldn't wait to] talk to her. Our session started & the first thing she said to me was, ""so you just met someone?"" & the rest of the reading was just incredible. Here's what I learned: Past lives: My mom & I were connected in a past life, which makes complete sense. We're so incredibly close & it's not that you should be able to understand why, but it's almost as though I don't know how it happened.

It wasn't life threatening and there wasn't any fear of his being paralyzed, but he was told by doctors that surgery, to fuse two discs, was required and that he would never play football again. She told me the surgery went well and he [couldn't wait to] go out to football practice just to see his teammates. As he was standing on the sidelines, wearing a neck collar, a number of his teammates came over on their way out just to wish him well, but only one of seven coaches stopped to ask him how he was doing and it wasn't the head coach. The mother told me it bothered her son a great deal and her as well. The coaching staff went straight out onto the field and got busy ""coaching"". This young man was no longer any use on the field, so he was no longer important, or so it seemed. I don't want to be overly critical because I don't know the coaches, but it's a stark reminder that anyone in the coaching business is ""Coaching for life"" and to get so wrapped up in the game could mean that you're leaving behind a trail of tears.",Fulfilled

Very nice, I'm very thankful, and I love her so much. Jenn and I went out to Griesbach today to give my new camera a spin. We had [hoped to] capture the colours of the trees there, but alas, the wind last week was too much too soon and the trees aren't in a very photogenic state. But! We drove to the west side of the old base and found an abandoned shooting range among some other derelict buildings, and many photos were had. Jenn even modeled for me and let me take some nice portraits. I am loving this camera. The first thing I really noticed about it is that it's fast.",Unfulfilled

It was not possible for me to give a birthday that had [hoped to] give, no thanks to plans that went awry from too many wanting to be able to spend your special day with you, and of course, no thanks to no ending changes that somehow switch the original courses that were set out.

And, that sleep I'd [hoped to] get was interrupted midway through by a thunderstorm that passed on by. At about 20 I was awakened by a bright flash of light and a clap of thunder so loud, the force of it caused about a half dozen car alarms to go off in the immediate vicinity of my building. I turned the TV on to see how much longer I'd have to put up with it, as the lightning and thunder were pretty constant.

Following a run, much needed shower, and even much more needed haircut, my friend Tia and I headed to a children's bookfair, featuring local authors and artists. The fair was packed, and all the kids were just running from booth to booth, excited to see each new Author.

Pre-Race I was up at 4:45 to shower, pack up, and have a quick breakfast before driving out to St. Albert. Transition opened up at 6:00 and the race was scheduled to start at 7:00 so I [wanted to] be sure that I would arrive as close to 6:00 as possible. The first thing I did was check in to get my race packet and my long sleeve race shirt. I was scheduled to be in heat 2 of the swim and had to check in poolside at 6:50 am. That wouldn't leave me very much time to set up and be ready. I headed over to get body marked, then grabbed my bike out of the car and headed over to rack it in transition.

There was no real problem with it being there other than it wasn't paying rent and it grossed people, most importantly women, out. So, on the tried-and-true principle that chicks dig scars more than benign fibrous tumours, I decided to have it lopped off.

I [wanted to] meet people and get my hands busy doing something other than holding books to read.

Maroon 5 (March 5) - I know I said in an earlier post that this is one concert I would gladly spend a lot to watch it in front, but, goodness, a ticket that costs more than 10k was not what I was planning on spending. I know Mylee agreed to watch it if I get to buy tickets that are around 5k, but only the 10k tickets were available in Ticketnet the last time I checked. I heard, though, that smart is selling tickets too so I'll try and see if they still have enough. 2. Incubus (March 9) - at the start I wasn't sure I [wanted to] watch them, but when I listened to their songs again, especially the ones from the new album, I realized I liked a lot of their songs. Again, tried to buy tickets for it, but the ones left in Ticketnet are in the seats right after general Admission. Sure, they're pretty cheap, but they're pretty high up, too, so Mylee wasn't interested in them either. 3. Colbie Caillat and Mandy Moore (March 12) - the timing of these concerts suck.",Unfulfilled

Arriving one hour later than planned, without being able to send tare an email to warn him about that since my email crapped out on me as well, we still had a cracking time. We visited a shop that couldn't decide what kind of tacky souvenirs it sold: Egyptian statuettes, everything even distantly related to Buddhism, Hinduism or just Asia in general, some weird things that were probably supposed to look African, and a good lot of good ol' western capitalism. It actually had a really relaxing atmosphere and I ended up buying some sandalwood incense and a little burner (been meaning to for some time now). I also found a really obscure and old book (it's in all fraktur blackletter, copyright is from 1916 and it was a cheap bastard thing even then) which is so crazy/lame/awesome/terrible/great that I will have to write about it later.

Hello?! in increasingly annoyed tones before finally hanging up. As you can imagine, this tended to put a damper on my social life. Fortunately phone terror is primarily a thing of my past.

The reason my parents didn't feel that they [wanted to] make the long slog up to Maine this year is that my mother has been diagnosed with clinical insanity. Well, I'm not sure she's been officially diagnosed, but she's clearly insane, because one of the first things she offered to Janet and me when we first arrived was the chance to go spend a night at a wilderness lodge alone, just the two of us, leaving the five children with her for over 24 hours. We tried to warn her. We really did. Please understand, I love my children to death, but there are five of them, consisting of about 7 teenaged egos and about 9 ""terrible twos"" tantrum-ers, and when they really get going, there's not a power on heaven or earth that can keep me from jamming pencils into my ears (#2 only please!) in order to stop hearing the squabbling.

2024,"Rules Engines provide real seperation of business logic from the software coding. There are two key entities: The rules themselves and the facts that the rules work on. The rules themselves can infer new facts from the facts that they are given which can lead to further rules being fired. This ""inference engine"" approach is amazingly powerful and the ""chaining"" of rules can lead to very powerful results with just a few simple rules. For more about business rules Engines see the following article in Wikipedia: http/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_engine I have been developing solutions on 3 different engines recently, which I [wanted to] share a brief view on: Jess (http/herzberg.ca.sandia.gov/) JBoss rules (Drools) (http/labs.jboss.com/drools/) Oracle Rules (http/ww.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/business_rules/index.html) Each of these platforms essentially offer the same general problem solving approach using inference engines and the ability to seperate business logic from coding.

The film's biggest fault is Christian Bale's Batman voice, or growl, or whatever you want to call it. I don't mind him having a husky, menacing Batman voice, but if it gets difficult to understand, you gotta scale it back, and when he's pleading with someone with a gun to a child's head, and it's a fairly emotional scene, you might expect Bruce Wayne's voice to peek through a crack here and there.

We started out Thursday night with a great dinner out to kick off our retreat and then back to the cottage for a big old slice of brownie Delight and setting up our sewing area. I hang my head when I type this, little silver came along but made very rare appearances can you believe I did that. I [wanted to] do 2 things, take pictures of what everyone was working on - and I did do that - but only a little, I thought about it when everyone was packed up yesterday and I [wanted to] bring along my tripod and get a group picture in front of the place with everyone - but I forgot to bring along the tripod. So I do have somethings to share just not like I had hoped. We jokingly called this a full service retreat. One of the peeps was out of town earlier in the week and had to miss her haircut appointment. Well she felt like she really needed to get it cut and took a chance on another salon while out of town because she couldn't wait for her next appointment. The story of the haircut is a long one - let's just say it wasn't purty, lol.",Fulfilled
2058,How is it that one little person can cause frustration and joy in a matter of 10min. Today I came home with Holly after shopping at Walmart(which included having her behind the cart pushing and making sure that she didn't run out at people)and she [wanted to] play so I put her down and unloaded the trunk. All the while having the mumma tirade because I wasn't over playing with her. This continued on while I unloaded the cold groceries and put her meal on to cook. I finally came out and my hand was immediately snatched up and I was pulled around the house to play in the sand box then we chased each other then danced and made flower bracelets... all this time the knot of frustration has been loosening and I'm amazed at how she can just be happy. Though only with mumma around or daddy. Some days I wish she could play without me right there and other days I relish the times where she lays in my arms and just wants me to rock her like a baby.,Fulfilled

I tried to put in a movie but the DVD player was unhooked and I couldn't figure out how to fix it, I tried to read but that didn't work, I finally settled on calling someone. But it was the night before classes and late so I called Jack. He was nice and came over to take me to his place to watch death Proof with him and Seneca. I was there for about 20 mins before Jack, taking notice of my snarky cynicism, asked if I [wanted to] go back to my apt to get my ice cream.

Another thing that seems better is the postpartum depression. I'm still taking the meds, but I feel like I could start to wean down if I [wanted to].

I could even do without the talking I guess, just nodding a quick goodbye after their set would have been enough. I didn't mean to get wrapped up in this again, but I should have suspected that I would. Nothing was really in my control when he's involved.

We decided that we'd rather spend #120 on holiday, not just getting there, and if we had to sit separately, we'd sit separately. When we got to the airport, we asked about it again- and were offered the chance to upgrade for #120, but told to ask again at the boarding gate. Well, we asked again at the boarding gate and they sat us together- for nothing. As neither of us takes up quite as much room as we used to, we're very glad we didn't upgrade!",Unfulfilled

Of course it all leads to the Sistine Chapel, which is by far the most beautiful piece of art I have ever seen. Words cannot do it justice. The Basilica was impressive; sadly we could not light candles. It seems they are afraid that at least one of the 30,000 visitors per day might burn it down.

I left my house in my car, only to see these two guys that look vaguely familiar from high school, one of them being this soccer player who was in both my physics and latin class and was a year below mine, and they were driving up to the cul-de-sac on the right, so I followed them because I thought he was cute and [wanted to] see if he noticed me. Of course, that was a negative. But Abby's house was right there in that cul-de-sac, so I get out to get her, and instead of Abby, ugly betty comes out instead. She gets into the driver's side, but then I tell her I should probably be the one who drives, and I ask her where she wants to go eat. She mentions this Mexican diner that's really good, I ask her where, and then she mentions as an afterthought that you have to be married in order to be served there. Anyhoo, so I'm turning back into my original street, going 65mph for some reason, and then suddenly I see a whole lot of flashing cop car lights, as well as traffic backed up all the way on the residential street behind them.

2070,Nice relaxing weekend. Friday we went to the humane Society to meet a dog. We [wanted to] spend more time with him before committing to adopting him so we put a reserve on him to go back Saturday and then went to Tubb's on University and saw Juno. Saturday I had my balls surgically removed and went to the wedding expo. It actually wasn't that bad and we made some progress on finding a photographer. Afterwards we went to the humane Society to spend some more time with the dog. He was a little distant and distracted so I was a little unsure about adopting him but Nikki assured me he'd warm up so we went ahead and adopted him.

On our walks, when we'd get to the place we [wanted to] turn around, usually we were a bit warm, so a dive into the ocean was necessary. It was a tad chilly too, but nice.

I was not aware that I would have to go put on hospital clothes, have surgery, and stay in recovery room for 2.5 hrs. Then I was told I would most likely have more headaches for about the weekend, only these would be spinal caused ones, and the only way to make them go away was to lay down.

I left the lights on, I'm sure I did. I had gone out this morning to get some more work done on my tattoo, it's progressing nicely but a lot more work to get done. I was in a better mood, mainly from the adrenaline but I [wanted to] get out into the black and stir up some trouble. I found the light switch after taking a detour around some loot that Keira has been meaning to move for a while, the lights pulsed into action and I was surprised to see the loot was gone, Keira's Claymore was docked and hooked up to some refuelling rigs. I walked around the Claymore to where my Rifter was docked and was suprised to see Keira grinning as I approached. ""I have a suprise for you"" she said. Really now, what could it be?",Unknown

The book is about Ellen caught between the two things she wants, her husband or the ex who had potential and lost something with it ending. I [wanted to] love this book, it had potential. But it just didn't reach what I felt it wanted to or was trying for. You know at the start of the book where you a just getting the surface of the characters and you know there is more to them, but you don't know it all yet, that is how I felt about the characters the whole time. I felt there was just something more that we were just about to find out or needed to know, but then we never found it out. The ending was kind of anticlimactic too. The other three books by this author are kind of a trilogy looking at the same situation from different perspectives and expanding on other areas that effected the other characters, so I hope that she does something like that with this one.",Unfulfilled

Went to Inverness shopping once, came home with a car, was absolutely devastated when our 4 1/2 year old dog had to get put to sleep, bought a car, dropped me off at Edinburgh Airport to take a flight to Liverpool, bought a car... see a pattern here? Impulsive. Going on holiday, let's just have a look at the new Mazda 6, three months later he had it. Anyway so we went up to look at a wee Clio for me, I wondered why the salesman was giving us a funny look, turns out he was one of the guys who sold my dad one of his mazdas, he recognised the number plate cause this one salesman promised people a whole load of things for free which he shouldn't've done and one was a personalised number plate.",Unfulfilled

So I [wanted to] do something easy to stick to, easy to think about, and so I went back to the tried and true: Weightwatchers. I had lost 30 pounds with WW before, and have actually kept most of it off. I then lost another 15 with Atkins, but that came back, so I pretty much am where I was when I ended WW, which was several years ago. Some minor fluctuations since then, but nothing to big.

It was sealed so well, that I was thinking that 30 hours or so if it being out of the fridge might not mean it is spoiled. I [wanted to] try it, but it turned out the house-sitter (a close friend of my wife's) accidentally broke the microwave. The door does not stay closed. Besides, I had met games the next two nights, so my next shot of actually testing my stomach would come last night. By then, I had picked up a new microwave - only it seemed to have bounced around in my minivan a bit too much; now, it is non-functional as well.

Stephen Daldry who also directed ""Billy Elliot"" and ""The hours""... and I couldn't be more happy after seeing one of the most talented young actresses in Hollywood taking the leading role... Kate Winslet will play Hanna... replacing pregnant Nicole Kidman... but I was a little worried after hearing that some people who saw a test screening of the unfinished film were confused with the end result... many thought the movie was disjointed... others could not know what the film [wanted to] say... well...

Follow your Dreams follow your dreams wherever they lead don't be distracted by less worthy needs. Shelter them, nourish them, help them grow, let your heart hold them down deep where dreams go. Be faithful, be loyal, then all your life through, the dreams that you follow will keep coming through. My sec 4 form teacher gave this to me cause back then my heart was set on pursuing dance. But looking back at those days, telling my friends boldly that I [wanted to] do nothing else but dance for the rest of my life, I laugh at how naive I was then. It was ironic in a way when I went to sajc to join the dance society cause I was impressed by their open house performance, and though I loved dance even more after that, it also taught me something even more valuable-passion is one thing,talent is another. Do I have what it takes if I want to become a dancer?

2122,"Hi all, apologies for my late entry, I had a huge timetable clash and was not aware until recently I was even in this class, even last week I was still attending my visual arts lecture's! Finally I am all sorted out although my mix up caused me to miss our first lecture and tutorial for 20th century literature, so I don't have much to write on that unfortunately. However I found week 2 quite intriguing we studied closely a piece by Wilfred Owen titled ""Letters to my mother"" What brutal language! I definitely would not tell my mother all that, unless I [wanted to] intentionally give her a heart attack! The poem states how horrific his experience is at war, this is expressed through letters he writes to his mother back home. Owen uses numbers to create imagery in lines like: ""Three quarters dead, I mean each of us three quarters"" the above line was very powerful to me I really imagined what it would be like in times as brutal as those I started to see in my mind imagery of grown men stumbling bleeding and hurt, dragging their legs behind them, to weak to even walk. Owen makes a comparison to his home life in the letters as he goes on to write: ""Six pm around the time you go to church, I'm living in seventh hell"" Six pm is usually a time of relaxation the work day has concluded and re cooperation occurs at this time, leisure activities and hobbies are also popular during this time of the day. Therefore to compare what he is going through to this time of day is a large comparison and has obvious differences which helps to make it clear to the readers just how hard it is for the men in their ""seventh hell""",Unfulfilled

There was 10 girls and only 7 female roles and I thought that we were just going to go home and have Lilly call us to see what part that we got but as soon as call backs were over, Matt told us that we could stay if we [wanted to] for the cast list. The whole time that we were in the waiting room talking and socializing I kept thinking that 3 girls were going to be disappointed. When Matt announced the cast I was really happy that I got ""Josh"" but I didn't show it instead I looked at the ground and avoided eye contact with everyone. I just felt so bad and a little embarrassed. However, I feel that we have a strong cast and I think that we are going to do a great job.

I also worried if he would be able to keep up with everything going on around him without becoming so overwhelmed. Today after dropping e.B. Off at school after his morning therapy session his teacher [wanted to] let me know how he was doing. I didn't dare ask because I know her time as a teacher is precious and that's what conferences were for.

Anyway, we ate at Ruby Tuesday's. I ordered an iced tea because I kinda [wanted to] make her pay for it. Too bad it was gross.

2145,"During holy Week I really began thinking about what I was getting from the church and what I was really giving back to it, and I realized pretty quickly that I was getting far more from it than I felt I was giving back to it. It has became a second home to me, and if they would let me put a cot and my computer there, I don't think I would leave except for work, the weekends I have Aiden, and the times I come up to see everyone in Boston. After holy Week was over, I was still praying on this issue when during a conversation with Abouna I mentioned in time I [wanted to] become a deacon, and he basically said there was no time like the present and that the next time a bishop was visiting us, I would be raised to a deacon. No sooner had the words passed than it seemed a bishop came to visit us the following weekend and with a prayer and a blessing of the spirit that has passed from Bishop to Bishop, from Pope to Pope all the way back to when Christ gave the breath of life to the disciples and apostles, I was able to come a step closer, but even in this the church was giving me more than what I was giving to it. Following this I was taken to the Cape for an exercise and while I would love to say that I lived a virtuous lifestyle, the simple truth is that I went from spiritual high to low as I allowed myself to be dragged through the muck and mire that comes all too easily with the military setting and I realized when all was said and done that while there were some humorous stories to tell about the exercise, I would not miss having to live that lifestyle any longer. After I returned I really started working at the church in earnest in the afternoons and it has became the highlight of the majority of my days. While I will admit that some of it stems from the fact I get to ride the lawn tractor at least once every other week, as well as keeping myself darker than my other half, it allows me to really give something that it seems these days people claim to have none of; my time, energy, and love. As we have entered the fast of the apostles, I have also began a new chapter in my relationship with the church as I will be working with the high school kids as youth mentor/Sunday school teacher/general ear for them to bend when they need a neutral party to speak with.",Fulfilled

Even if Chopin herself didn't have to struggle against many constraints personally it was because of her husband's open mind, and she was certainly subject to the societal pressures that surrounded her.

I woke up fairly early, took a shower in my immaculately clean bathroom and had breakfast with the family. I played a game with Cosima for awhile after, and then Cosima, Karin and Morris went to the big garage sale to collect their money for the things they sold. I talked to mama, and she got the chance to see the family. Cosima started tickling me in the middle of the conversation, and then brought Morris in, and Karin finally made an appearance and asked me if I [wanted to] go to the small festival thing. I did, and I went. It was tiny, mostly consisting of several drinking stands and then a big jumping castle for the children.

Sadly, I didn't have enough time to see everybody I [wanted to] see, or to spend as much time as I wanted with those I did see, but all I had to spare for this trip was the three days of my normal work weekend because I have no paid time off left for the moment. Salt Lake City has changed in some ways, and stayed remarkably (and unfortunately) the same in many others. I'm not quite sure how I feel about that. I don't think I could live here again, at least not for very long, but I didn't have enough time away from family to really explore how the city itself has grown in the eight years since I left it. My flight home is in four hours, and I'll be leaving for the airport in two. It's been enough of an escape that I think I'm ready to go home and try to put my life back together.",Unfulfilled
2211,"Yay yay. After another fun Astro class, I went down to the bank and withdrew some money and then went to the hub where I met up with Kristian, who's a guy I knew from last year who's the only one of my group of friends who made any effort to stay in contact with me. He gets bonus points for that. He was hanging out with some friends, because truth be told he's just visiting here; he transfered schools. I got myself some tea and joined them for a bit, but eventually I kind of got bored so I left. The girl there was from Pittsburgh, though, and she really [wanted to] see my drumset so I gave her my phone number and was on my way to the bookstore. I had some time before the bus going to the mall left, so I read more of the loner book. I really like it a lot. There was one section talking about loners in music, and how a lot of the old rock and roll icons, like Kurt Kobaine and John Lennon were loners and that music is being replaced by hip-hop which is all about ""getting down with your homies"" and images of huge, sweaty parties where sex is handed out like candy, which is part of the reason why I just don't like hip-hop. Also they were talking about the transformation of the loner's role in movies, from film noir and old western and superhero movies where the loner is the hero, and then eventually became the anti-hero, and then the villain.",Unknown

I am a big fan of anything that is shiny and sparkly and I love to add a little of that on my scrapbook layouts whenever I can. First I [wanted to] stamp a subtle pattern on my background but I also wanted it to be shiny and a little sparkly so I chose making Memories' rose Pearl glaze.

2215,"So somehow today ended up being awesome. I was hoping something fun would happen--it's my day off and since I don't have a car I usually hang out in the lobby and hope someone I know is doing something fun. I didn't see anyone all morning, but when I was going to lunch I ran into a couple of friends who said they were thinking of going to moose Falls (one of the few hot-spring type places in the park where we're actually allowed to swim). At lunch, though, the guy with the car (same guy as in the last entry... in fact, it's almost always him taking me places) said they [wanted to] take like eight people and that there wouldn't be room for me unless I found another ride. Fat chance. I went back to the dorms and got online (sort of) and continued to write a little (sort of) until dinner. I was feeling kinda down because it looked like I was going to spend my last Sunday off doing nothing again, but at dinner I found guy-with-car and since no one seemed to know what the plan was we were all like ""screw this, lets just go.""

So yeah, very weird to think about how many brain subconsciously organizes music Also last night at work, Kathleen called me out of the blue (see what I did there with the color thing?). I almost never get calls from her unless we're trying to set something up, so I was pleasantly surprised. It turns out she [wanted to] go out to a bar but didn't want to go by herself, and since I was in the area and off at roughly the same time she was going down, did I want to join her?

I'm of the opinion that prayer should be an ongoing dialog and not saved up for designated times, but it helped us learn to pray together and get more comfortable praying out loud.

Lesley met me outside in quite a bad temper herself and informed me that our father had been behaving ""utterly psychotically"".

It turned out to be a great success, it was very original. I had done a mirror image of the front of the album on the reverse side, but with the bird's feathers floating along the branch, as if it had flew away. The inside of the piece was kind of a scrapbook idea, where it was like writing your ideas on paper before putting it all together.

There was a raft trip taking out, and I schmoozed the guides to see if I could get a ride with them, but they were noncommittal, so I started the walk up to the highway where I would stick out my thumb and take my chances. It's a pretty big hill up to the highway, so whenever I heard a car coming up behind me I stuck out my thumb. The first vehicle was full.",Unknown
2250,"This is the 3rd year in a row that my mom has put together some kind of family vacation that involved all of us. Since our vacations growing up generally involved driving about 3500 miles in the car with various low-key stops along the way visiting family, these recent extravagances have been a surprise, although we're definitely not complaining. My parents feel very fortunate to be in the situation to do this, and they're making it happen before time runs out, and you just never know when that will be. So as I've mentioned before, this summer is their 50th anniversary and they [wanted to] do something memorable with the family. My dad has somewhat limited stamina and mobility, so going on a busy trip with lots of walking is not a good idea. Last summer's vacation was hard on us because we were all cooped up in a fairly small house, and the boy seemed to get on everybody's nerves. This trip promised to be better because although there would be lots of time spent with family, we also had the option to retreat to our own room or go to the children's play area or just go somewhere away from everyone. From what I could tell, the cruise seemed to work well for all the different ages and personalities in our group (21 people total). There were so many distinct activities to do on the ship, but you could also be completely content just sitting and watching the scenery go by.",Fulfilled

I was nauseated the whole time and just so friggin irritated I felt like I [wanted to] scream. I'm trying to SLEEP I told the contractions.

Finally, the mountain monkey, who I haven't been separated from for more than the length of a work day in over six months, is on Rainier as of this morning. Now, don't get me wrong; although I'm quite certain I could have spent another six months with him without interruption, I am enjoying the time to myself. As he said the other day, ""I've never spent so much time with someone and [wanted to] kill them less"" or something like that. I'm getting settled in to his Our place, cleaning, going to bed early, spending quality time with the Taz monster, time with friends, and so on. It's all good, it's just odd trying to arrange furniture, for example, without his input. He did confirm this morning that he was thrilled not to have been here while I went through my closets, though. Even from far away he makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.

I'm afraid I got a little bit emotional on the phone. He did apologize... for last night. He still refuses to apologize for what happened in July.

We only had the one day to spend in Xi'an which is to the north west of Shanghai in Shaanxi province, so we flew in early in the morning and flew out later that night. It was a busy day with lots to fit in so we booked a driver and an English speaking tour guide to take us everywhere we [wanted to] go. This company was great, they were there to pick us up when our plane came in and drop us off in time for our flight later that night. Our tour guide Allan was a Chinese history master's student who was full of information, my mind was a little boggled at times. It was great though to be on our own schedule for the day and to do whatever we wanted. We decided to hit 3 of the main spots in Xi'an, although this city is so full of history that we could have used a few more days. We started at the terracotta Warriors which is supposedly the new 8th wonder of the world.",Fulfilled

There, Americans could either 1 go to the airports to wait for international flights to resume -- but all airport hotels had filled up to no vacancy as tourists flocked to the airport cities -- so it would basically mean living in an airport until flights resumed. I believe Sherri put it as ""When or if"" flights resumed. At this point, on September 13, 2001, two days after American planes had been used as weapons of mass destruction, it was uncertain if we could get back to the US via plane. The other option we were given, if we [wanted to] leave Egypt, was 2 they could put us up in a hotel in a non-airport city, where we would wait, indefinitely, until flights resumed -- and then it would be our responsibility to get to an airport in another city! Needless to say, I did not even entertain the idea. Because option 3 just stay on the tour schedule, made the most sense to me.

I was almost fifteen, a small puny thing with long dark brown tangled hair and glinting blue eyes, constantly tagging after my older cousins. I was visiting from America, or so I told them, and [wished to] live like they did. ""An adventure, a Lark before I go back home and learn the life my mother wants for me,"" I said to them that bright chilly morning I arrived on aunt Maureen's doorstep. My aunt Maureen was well aware of the life my mother wanted for me and disapproved of it as greatly as if I was her daughter. If my story sounded a little forced and full of holes, what of it? She was glad to see me once more. It had been decided amongst the older members of the family I would stay with Aunt Laura, as she had the most room since her Nona had gone off to marry her Henry last spring and would help at the farm there.",Unknown

Much to my family's dismay, I had just let go of everything from my previous life: My job, my apartment, my future, and had still not adjusted to my new surroundings.

For instance, someone with OCD may also have a social phobia or something like that. This includes body image disorders, which are actually quite easily linked to anxiety.

My other brother forced him to perform some tricks for us, he made some card guessing tricks pretty cool but nothing much. He wasn't prepared for it so of course there wasn't much he could do, but there was one trick that amazed me: He started throwing cards on the table while looking away and asked a person to tell him when to stop, when he stopped he grabbed the next card that he was about to throw and gave it to that person and told her to memorize it (she got 2 of diamonds), he then put the card back on the deck shuffled and gave it to my brother and asked him to take a random card, he did and got 5 of clubs the magician looked confused and told him to get another card my brother did so and got the Q of spades, the guy looked confused again and said shit!",Fulfilled

I tried to hold on longer, but the urge is so strong. At first when we came together as a team, it was fun, exhilarating, a bit nerve wrecking as we were both new to each other, even though she was more experienced than me. Even though she treated me well and took me to where I [wanted to] be as best as she could, despite me not treating her as good as I should have, I still think it's time we moved on.

And when I fist saw Anne Hathaway ont he becoming Jane poster, I thought she was the perfect person to play the part. The love of Jane Austen and Tom Lefroy was much like the love Jane Austen depicted in pride and Prejudice. The leading man in Jane's life was arrogant, much like the leading man in pride and Prejudice, and both leading ladies were very well-learnt andboth were curious of the arrogant young men. So, in my opinion, Jane basicaly described her romantic experience through her perhaps most famous work, pride and Prejuidice.",Fulfilled

My current journal is the past two years- I was always praying for God to heal my marriage and help me understand if I was dishonoring my husband and what I could do- I was always saying how I was lonely and I could ""read"" my tears through the lines. I was a little shocked at how miserable I really was- one entry spefically when I realized why I was shocked at my own pain- I wrote down about how I didn't want to be a disappointment to my children with divorce or not being a good wife. I [wanted to] be an example to my family and to others- being a Christian I always thought that prayer and hard work would bring me out of my pain. When Jess wanted a divorce I felt as though I had failed in some way, but now I understand that God simply answered my prayers!! I don't want to go into detail of my misery- there is one person in particular I feel comfortable sharing this with other than God and He is my best friend. I thank God for him. However, I will say that I am done worrying about how others will see me- not to the extent that I will ""do whatever I want"" but just to say that I owe no explanations and the truth is people will judge me no matter what and God knows my heart so that's all that matters. I have so many people telling me that I am not ""feeling"" correctly with the way a divorce should go.",Fulfilled

Whatever motivation I have to go is just because I'm bugged to out of obligation because it's mbv, but like... if I [wanted to] go alone I could've gone to the Santa monica show which I could just drive to and I bought the San francisco tickets months ago thinking ""oh hey, this is perfect, I fly up to San francisco Friday, spend time with Jessica throughout the days, go to the show together, and I bounce back home Wednesday"" because spending time in San francisco was always nice. Seeing mbv wasn't even the most appeal of going up there really, and now that I'm actually considering to just make it simple and skip it, it feels right because it really was just a way to spend time with Jessica. Gah why is it so hard to move on and not think about her and this stuff has to come up? But at least I'm thinking about the best for me, seeing mbv was more about having something special to do with my girlfriend than me going to the show itself. That's what it seems to come down to now that I've analyzed it... but I have to give it more thought before I tell my mom or cousin (whom I've been hesitant to call to make definite plans still).

We have been up north and visited the Miyazawa Kenji (children's Author and all round dude) museum and theme park - both utterly fab. Arrived in Toyko on Monday and caught the new Miyazaki film, Ponyo on the Ciff by the sea, and were amazed that we understood pretty much all of it (only the resolution was a touch confusing without subs) and over 50% of the dialogue. Now, it is a kids' film but we were hugely relieved at how much our Japanese had improved. Staying with the Ghibli theme, we managed to book tickets (you can only purchase them in advance and have to pre-book a date and time slot) for the Ghibli layout exhibition at the museum of Contemporary Art. They had over 1000 Ghibli background drawings on display - with director instructions and notes - and we spent hours in there.",Fulfilled

Anyways so we get into this like airjet thing that they use in the airforce and put on some crazy full face motorcycle helmets. Then we flew around and started blowing stuff up with laser beams, it WAS SO cool. Then we landed at some park and joined in on some baseball team, and when I was running to third base I fell on my ass and everyone laughed. Then some of my friends started playing with a really cute dog, then I woke up;-; this dream was awesome and so much better than my usual dreams which usually involves some crazy nuclear war/holocaust/my friends dying in my arms, so emoo.

I have grown so exhausted with the troubles that have already started because I'm friends with the same people as she is. She being someone who used to be a close friend of mine until she hurt a loved one and me horribly. I had told her why we could not be friends, and she started hated me for something that was her fault.

Then, since it was 9/11, I took her to McSorley's, an old school Irish pub in the village. I [wanted to] show her the real new York with real new Yorkers, not the tourist bullshit full of tourists. The bar was packed full of firefighters in uniform that had come from the Memorial ceremony at ground zero. And they were all drunk.

There was plenty of backlash and discussion on the daring Bakers private forums about how this challenge was too similar to other challenges or too restricting. It astounded me that some people were so against this challenge, for me being a daring Baker is about being surprised each month with a recipe to make that I didn't choose myself. Sometimes it is something that I have [wanted to] make myself for a while, sometimes they are recipes I wouldn't have chosen in a million years - but even those that I wouldn't have chosen still challenge me in some way. I am in no way against people voicing their opinions, there is just a fine line to walk between doing that and complaining for the sake of being negative. When it comes down to it, we joined this group and we must follow its rules. I think some of the people who were complaining have lost sight of the purpose of the daring Bakers - to bake & have fun while doing so. If you don't like a recipe, sit out from that challenge, there is no point making a big fuss about it. Anyway, onto my challenge experience!",Fulfilled

It was there I recovered after a day of shrooming, watched the colors play across the soft teal treeline as the sun sank below the horizon and the lightning bugs skipped over the grass. And it was there I realized who I loved the most, despite anything I tried to tell myself. Once in a while I see other people visiting this park, but rarely in the middle of the night. I had downloaded some new songs by Steve Miller Band, the velvet Underground, and the clash, so of course I [wanted to] run to the park and enjoy my new music.

The convention was largely effective in taking the race angle off the table and focusing on lower taxes and John McCain's biography. If there is one theme that Republicans have effectively put into the minds of many Americans is that redistribution of wealth through taxes is bad for the economy. Never mind that Republicans must take responsibility for the fact that real wages have fallen for the last 30 years, except during the Clinton administration, for all but the top 5% of earners even though Americans of all stripes have never been more productive and that our healthcare system has lead record numbers of workers into bankruptcy or without basic healthcare.

The doc said he's supposed to gain an ounce a day, so in the two weeks since he saw her last, he should have gained almost a pound. He weighed in at 9 lbs 4 oz (last time he weighed 7lbs 6oz) so he's gained almost two pounds! He's definitely getting enough. He does have reflux though, so she put him on Axid for two weeks. I hope it will help because my poor baby spits up alot after feedings no matter what position I put him in.",Fulfilled

I could barely walk the straight line from the bed to the laptop and back again. I talked to sis for a bit, which helped. She [wanted to] know why I kept a public journal. So I talked a bit about that. We talked about a bunch of other stuff - what she was up to, what I was up to. I expressed some jealousy over her current free state, unencumbered by this stuff that is stuck to me like a shell to a snail. Will I die if I remove it? We puzzled over the advice I had been given to cut the cord with mum ie tell her to stop trying to interact with me . We can predict exactly what the fallout will be if I announce it.",Fulfilled

The children's ward had a school on the bottom floor still full of books and two ""movie"" theatres with the rusted projectors still intact. This building had obviously been abandoned much longer [both were built in the 1800s but the main adult building wasn't abandoned for asbestos until 1982 when it was kept up as a general hospital and rumored as an insane asylum as well] because the ceiling tiles and metal and wall coverings were all killed to shit and powder lying on the floor, and no footprints. All of the graffitti seemed to be in the main building and not the children's dorms, which were quiet and intact--the mattresses had rotted and fallen in, but one set of drawers still had a child's vanity mirror left unbroken and a ratty doll of a koala on the bed. There are still more buildings and we have yet to find the morgue we know still remains... we think it's on the bottom floor of the adult building, but when we were there last it was flooded too much for Chris[he was wearing sneakers, not boots] and it was so cold and dark none of us were sure we really [wanted to] go in just yet.

It got to be around 100 and she [wanted to] go surprise Eric when he got off work, so we headed to the movie theater. We got the awesome idea of messing with him and switching his car around and we were going to hide in his backseat and scare the shit outta him when he got in the car. Too bad it was really bright in the parking lot and he would have seen us if we did that. So I came up with the most stupid plot I have ever thought of in my entire LIFE which goes as following: ""let's hide in the trunk."" Great idea huh? We get in, Bonnie shuts the lid.

I had become increasingly impatient with how much work was going into the Artist's way collective because I felt that it was taking me away from my novel, the thing that I truly [wanted to] be investing in. But I kept coming back to the fact that the Artist's way was helping me to become more creative and thus a better writer. It would help me write the book better when I came back to it.

In those sweet early years in San Francisco, my father vividly remembers his mother's pencil drawings of dancers in costume, how she brushed her long brown tresses by bending her head forward, how she transmitted to him the awe and wonder of lightening, by holding him up to the window to show it to him and how he discovered that bravery had its cost when he was stung trying to catch a Bumblebee in the palm of his hand indoors.

2883,"I set up a FreeBSD 3.0 box at work when 3.0 was released.I was impressed by the performance gains over 2.2.Not only that, but because FreeBSD was a unified system and not a kernel with a bunch of seemingly randomly selected userland tools around it, I didn't have to worry about red Hat using a broken compiler or everyone but Slackware switching to elf or every Linux distro on earth using a different libc at one time.So I finally nuked Slackware and went FreeBSD 3.0 fulltime.I kept up with FreeBSD through 5.0. But by then I [needed to] upgrade my hardware, and FreeBSD was very behind the curve at that point with supporting new hardware. I ended up switching to windows 2000, which I really didn't think was that bad.It was stable, stayed out of my way, and I had no problems finding hardware drivers.Around this time, I changed jobs and worked in a place that had a few Solaris 7 boxen.Again, it was a bit of a learning curve because it did things differently from FreeBSD.I wasn't particularly impressed by it, but a lot had to do with not having bought the developer tools from sun and the difficulty in getting GCC and much of the GNU userland to work well and coexist with sun's userland.",Fulfilled

The third technique [required that] I sit up a little with one knee up and then using my afflicted arm on leg and pull.

As soon as we got there we were taken back to meet with the ER doctor who decided she [needed to] be admitted for some IV fluids. After an hour or so of many nurses coming in and looking at her little fat feet and hands they decided to send her upstairs to have a pediatric nurse put in the IV.We were admitted and they managed to get her IV in without too much of a problem.One doctor came by and said they would be putting antibiotics directly into IV and drawing a blood sample.Then another doctor came and said he wanted a stool sample and a chest xray done.So we were assured that they were going to cover all the bases and soon we would know how to help our little Abi get better.,Fulfilled

I was seventeen) was on the insanity defense, because I had a year-long project and that was my part of it.

Eventually, I got them back to the huge oak table I had staked out, tried to figure out how the page-numbering in multi-volume journals worked, eventually found one of the articles, and started to read.About one paragraph in, there would be a citation which I could not understand in the slightest, using symbols I'd never seen before.""So then I had a specific question, and I took it to a librarian and said, """"What does this mean, and where can I find it?"""" and the librarian would say, """"Oh, that's section___ of statute ___, and this here means you can find it there.""""""So then I'd see if I could go to reading the article, but of course I couldn't, so I went and found the statute cited, which I could not fully understand, so I went to the gigantic dictionary and looked up 1/3 of the words, copied out the relevant section of the statute, went back to the article, read three more paragraphs, and discovered that this article was written to refute an earlier article and didn't make sense if I hadn't read the earlier article, and--And so, ass-backwards and entirely independently, I ended up giving myself the haphazard equivalent of a pre-law class.",Fulfilled

And up to Annapolis where we rounded up another old friend -Louis Seneci -who had been the boyfriend of one of my former roommates.With Louis, we headed to a restaurant out by the Chesapeake Bay where he and I feasted on hard-shell crabs and my kids -cowards that they were -ate hamburgers as they thought the crabs were just too gross. Actually, my son did try some and found they were pretty good but he was already locked into the burger and fries he had [ordered] to begin with. From there, after dropping Louis off, we headed back home for a day -so I could get my Avon order sent in on the required date.Avon sales stop for no one ya know.When we left Annapolis it was about 11 p.m. And I headed north towards route 70 -knowing I could pick that up around Baltimore and once on route 70, I could find my way back home almost blindfolded.However, of course, I had no map with me so I was just sort of flying by the seat of my pants, heading north and west and figuring eventually I would come upon route 70.What I didn't count on though was getting into Baltimore -my first time ever in that fine city -and I hadn't a clue as to what each part of the city was like -good neighborhood, iffy or down right rough and scary.",Fulfilled

We were all overtired, and no one had really slept well, but that didn't stop the kids from having abundant energy.It did stop us grown ups from coping with it as elegantly as we would have liked though.I managed to get a cheap pair of sunglasses, since I had forgotten to bring mine and it was very bright outside.We spent some time in the pool and playing a skateboarding video game (of which my almost 6 year old nephew soundly defeated everyone else).It was good to catch up with my cousins and my parents and I went to Shabbat services with them in the evening.",Fulfilled

The place had delicious food it was however so remote that at times they would run out of ingredients, for instance the owner had [ordered] flour 2 weeks in advance and it hadn't come yet so for a day there were no chips, no bread, and no tortillas, but we survived. We left the next day, dropped our friend Chris off at the bus terminal in Coban, and drive towards Santa Elena and the small island next to it in Lago de Peten Itza called Flores.It was a full day of driving which included among other things a rickety river ferry crossing.Flores is quite built up because it is the jumping off point for the very popular Mayan site of Tikal but also at the northern fringe of civilization in Guatemala.We met up with a group of random people in Flores that we met at El Retiro and discussed hiking to the Mayan site of El Mirador.The next day we met up with an outfitter who has been arranging trips to the site for 9 years and we bargained for $200US/pp for a 6 day hike in the Guatemalan jungle to Tintal, El Mirador, Nakbe, and la Florida with a guide and 7 mules/horses (they held drinking water, tents, blankets, and basic food) as long as we could convince 7 people to go.",Unfulfilled

It took a long time to get where you [needed to] go--significantly longer than it did by car--and I couldn't travel after 6pm or on weekends.
